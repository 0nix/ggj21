  a183a: "[say]Surveillance starts at 0500 hours on Friday, March 12th.",
  a184a:
    "[say]In the early morning you get a report from Division XIX that there was no veto on file for the gag placed on Hassel and Letizka for that package that had arrived on Wednesday the 10th. ",
  a185a:
    "[say]Nobody in the Division even had a a record of the package in question, which was extremely surprising considering that the surveillance operation had started at a higher level in the chain-of-command than usual State Security work on suspects for sedition and dessertion. The package may have been sent before the gag order, but the package would have at least have had a record of recipt and transfer at the local Post Office, a record that should not have been expugned since those last up to three months. Nobody dropped the package personally, since that would have been caught on surveillance, and the person who would do it immediately detained and interrogated. ",
  a186a:
    "[say]Which meant that somebody within either the structure of the Ministry or the Party itself made sure to deliver the package without any tracking or tracing. <- Clue",
  a187a:
    "[say]You observe at 0530 hours unusual rummaging at this particular time from the bedchambers. Shortly after you see Leitzka hauling around a suitcase to the living room, opening it to get a few books. She rearranges its contents in a hasty manner, and proceeds to stuff the package she obtained in the suitcase. She is at flight risk and leave the reach of immediate surveillance. ",
  a188a:
    '[say]You start to phone in for a State Security squad when you hear Hassel calling from the bed chambers. "Nadine, Nadine, where are you?"',
  a189a:
    '[say]"In the kitchen, Albert. I thought I\'d make breakfast." Leitzka responds in a hurried tone, and closes her suitcase.',
  a190a:
    '[say]"Ah, are you? I don\'t think I hear any cooking noises, though." Hassel yells from the bedroom.',
  a191a:
    '[say]"I just started Albert, sorry to have woken you up." Leitzka says, hurrying to the kitchen and turning on the stove and assembling breakfast foods. The suitcase she was putting together is sitting atop of the sofa. As you observe her perparing food, you make the phone call to have an arrest squad stand at the ready.',
  a192a:
    "[say]Thirty minutes later, Hassel joins Leitzka at the kitchen and sits down for breakfast, they exchange small talk about nothing in particular that is subject to the investigation. Leitzka is evasive and curt with her responses, a textbook case of flight risk from surveillance.",
  a193a:
    '[say]You observe Hassel inquire Leitzka about a vacation. "Say Nadine, what agrees with you more dear? Summer, or autumn?"',
  a194a:
    '[say]"I don\'t understand your question, Albert." She says barely audible above a whisper.',
  a195a:
    '[say]"Summer or autumn, which one do you like best? I\'m asking for the trip to Riga." Albert says in between mouthfuls of food. "See, I hear Riga is nice for either but you might hate the sunshine and the people in summer."',
  a196a:
    '[say]"Me... the sunshine? Is that what you want to ask me?" Lietzka asks, with a tone of incredulity.',
  a197a:
    '[say]"Of course! We\'re going since that whole aff-aff-affair with State Security is over, they told me the exit visas would be ready in no time. No time at all." Hassel says with a cheery tune.',
  a198a:
    "[say]\"But, you don't *have* them do you? You didn't actually get documents, right?\" Leitzka says with an even greater sneer.",
  a199a:
    '[say]"Why would they tell me otherwise Nadine? I don\'t get your questions, honestly." Hassel responds, dismissively.',
  a200a:
    "[say]Lietzka sits up and after a brief silence she responds, \"I don't believe this. You actually trust them, don't you?\" She says.",
  a201a:
    '[say]"They look out for us, Nadine. Sometimes they might be a bit unpallatable or brutish, but it\'s all well and good." Hassel says, with a bit more firmness. ',
  a202a:
    "[say]Lietzka starts laughing in response. First a bit softly, then raising up in volume to a sort of cackle. This has Hassel stunned since you observe he has stopped moving or speaking. After she's done cackling, she breathes in heavily and stands up. \"Enjoy your breakfast, Albert. I'm not hungry anymore.\" she says before going back to the bed chamber.",
  a203a:
    '[say]"Wait, wait, w-wait. Nadine? Wh-where are you going?" Hassel inquires with a tinge of nervousness.',
  a204a:
    "[say]Leitzka doesn't respond until she emerges from the halway, dressed up. \"A couple of days ago, I asked myself. Now I know. I can't really trust you, Albert. Can't trust you to keep to yourself, can't trust you to do something righ, I can't even trust you to have thoughts made on your own.\"",
  a205a:
    '[say]"What\'s that supposed to mean? What is all this out of the blue, Nadine?" Hassel asks, increasingly incensed.',
  a206a:
    '[say]"Do I have to spell it out for you lover-boy?" Nadine responds, standing by the hallway entry. ',
  a207a:
    "[say]Hassel, enraged, stands up from the kitchen and confronts Leitzka.",
  a208a:
    '[say]"Perhaps I made a mistake of my own," Albert  says "because I really trusted you. I truly did." This gets a surprise out of Leitzka. "I thought finding you was an act of divine providence, I got to see the girl I loved when I was just a scholboy and do all the things I desperately wanted to do back then. I should have know better -- better than to allow you to live with me."',
  a209a:
    "[say]Leitzka truns around without saying a word and dissappears out of the camera frame. \"Yes, Nadine. Please! Run away, run away like you always do. Like you do in your 'visits to the cafeteria'. I asked the cashier about you to make small talk, and you would never guess what happened? She has never heard of you! Ever! I just assumed you went out of your way to go to another coffee shop I don't know about, silly me! I asked Laurie about you, and she said you had not seen each other in three months! Sily me, maybe we are talking about different Lauries, convenient!\" Hassel lashes out. <- Leitzka covertly leaves the flat without a known destination.",
  a210a:
    "[say]\"Oh God, don't speak that woman's name in my presence again, Albert! That woman has a wet sponge for a brain!\" Leitzka snaps back from a location away form the cameras, presumably the bedroom they both share. ",
  a211a:
    '[say]"Shout it louder, dear!" Hassel responds. "Who knows who is listening, it might be her!" ',
  a212a:
    "[say]Lietzka comes into the living room again and slaps Hassel across the face. You observe Hassel taken aback, completely caught off guard. A brief silence is exchanged between the two of them.",
  a213a:
    "[say]\"I-I-I'm leaving, Albert. We're through. I wish I had never given you my book to read, or my pamphlets for that m-matter. When you walk out that door, and go see your party w-whatever, I will have left. Yes... yes. I will have left\" Leitzka stammered through that, but as she kept deliniating her plans, she became resolute. <- Wealth of Nations copy is owned by Nadine Leitzka.",
  a214a:
    "[say]You observe Hassel staring at her, and they exchange another brief silence. Hassel's facial expressions are not intelligible through the camera, but it is a safe bet he is processing Leitzka's words. \"The moment I saw those leaflets from United Left I should have dropped you at the police station. But, I will keep my silence, and I should caution you to keep yours.\" He finally says coldly. <- Hassel did not report Leitzka, however Leitzka is in the posession of directly subversive literature.",
  a215a:
    '[say]"You know, I had it all planned out for us," Hassel says softly, just above the threshold for microphone pick up. "No," Leitzka responds "not far enough. Not nearly far enough. I thought we could leave, together. But you\'re afraid, too afraid. And, I don\'t blame you."',
  a216a: "[say]You observe Leitzka taking a deep breath.",
  a217a: '[say]"If you saw what I see for the future, it would scare you."',
  a218a:
    "[say]You observe Leitzka appearing again on camera, leaving through the front door of the flat and out into the street. Flight risk measures are activated, and are now directed to apprehend her in a 3 block radius of the flats.",
  a219a:
    '[say]Alone in his apartment Hassel starts destroying his belongings, loudly crashing and banging everything he can see. It\'s quite annoying to listen to, let alone observe  "Nadine! Nadine!" He screams. Of course, nobody responds.',
  a220a:
    "[say]After approximately an hour later, his belongings mostly broken or dented, he sits on the sofa in silence, and opens a cabinet next to him. Form it he produces a cigarrette pack, a lighter, and a small porcelain dish. You observe him light up a cigarrette and smoke it in silence.",
  a221a:
    "[say]After finishing his cigarrette, you observe him pick up the phone and let it produce the open line tone. He starts speaking into the telephone as if somebody was on the other line, when there isn't. His breath is labored, presumably from the cigarrette he just smoked.",
  a222a:
    "[say]Hassel: Are you listening? Of course you are, you are the State Security. Are you enjoying this? Did you watch me an Nadine going at it? Did you watch us eat breakfast and watch television? I hope it was worth it, I hope you got something out of it as much as you did you damn perverts. Always looking, always watching, I do wonder when did I catch your attention. Was it when she came in the apartment? Was it when she gave me that book to read? You know something, I loved it. I loved reading about, I loved reading about how you could actually make something out of yourself instead of being a bug under the thumb made by a million bureaucrats. I work, and I work.... and I work until I'm a ragged doll and I will get a scoop of mud and a punch to the head for my troubles. But it's not enough is it? It's not enough for you, you also have to drink from my cup and eat from my plate, and watch me, watch me, watch us all take a dump, fall in love, have a thought. Watch us forever. Nadine wanted to leave so bad... Maybe I'd like to go too... To a place you can't find me, you can't watch me, you can't hear me you... You --hnnng-- f-f-f-fffuck-fucking Stasi professional perverts. Fuck you, fuck you all to hell.",
  a223a: "[say]The one-sided conversation ended there.",
  a224a:
    "[say]You put in a word at the local constabularies for the detainment of Albert Hassel should he exit a 30 meter perimeter from the flats. He is also at flight risk, and you phone the State Security constabulary to assemble a squad for Hassel's detainment should he attempt to leave the premises.",
  a225a:
    "[say]At 0915 hours, you recieve confirmation of the preliminary detainment of Nadine Leitzka. She is being held in a low-risk cell at Hohenschönhausen. Which is perfect since that's the end of surveillance operations. Given that both of the subjects of surveillance have order for detention, cover surveillance is no longer advisable nor necessary.  You take your last notes and start putting together the case files.",
  a226a:
    "[say]You give orders to the Field Office to detain Hassel if he attempts to leave the premises, and to detain him anyway if he didn't come out of his flat in two hours time. It was time to assemble all the evidence since gathered and to make the final determination as to who to keep in containment and who to let go.",

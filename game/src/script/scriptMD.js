	"a1": "[say]You arrive to the surveillance site, a five-story building in Friedrichsfelde, within a surprinsgly a short distance from Headquarters. Mostly brown, with a few blotches of colors in the windows from the furnishings of the tenants. Room 6 is the field office. On paper, it's where a pensioner resides. A lifetime of service to the Party has given her free lodgings, free food, free everything. That is, as long as she keeps to all of ten square meters and the rest of the house functions as an outpost for Division XIX. At least she gets something out of a lifetime of work.",
	"a2": "[say]You hand in your paperwork and you are led to a dark room lit only by the glow of the tube monitors, and the blinking lights of recording equipment. A desk populated by cathode-ray-tube, long reel recorders, plenty notebooks and pens, a typewriter, and a standard issue Ministry of State Security pair of headphones that could masticate your entire head if they were alive.",
	"a3": "[say]The two bedroom flat is located a few floors above you, and is fitted with two cameras, the kitchen and the living room. The phone line bugs are active, as is standard issue ten-milimeter microphones dotted in every room. It was weird for a subject that was previously not considered a threat to the state to have video surveillance, but it appears Bryce had gone ahead of you in operations and installed them anyway. Preliminary surveillance before your addition to the team stated that at least one occupant constantly remained in the house, namely this Nadine Lietzka. Not odd for a housewife, however to your knowledge Ms. Leitzka was not married to Mr. Hassler. While it's not illegal for couples to occupy the same dwelling, it still raises some eyes from older agents at entry-level surveillance. As much as the Party wants to avoid it, society is like a river: It changes and flows.",
	"a4": "[say]Your long watch begins, as you sit down on the metal chair provided to you, and, by the light of television, you lay in wait to observe and record.",
	"a5": "[say]Observe and record. You are the Sword and Shield of the State.",
	"a6": "[say]#### Day 1",
	"a7": "[say]Surveillance starts at 1500 hours on a Tuesday, March 9th.",
	"a8": "[say]You observe Nadine Leitzka, washing dishes in the kitchen. She hums a tune you can't quite make through the microphone and the noise of the rushing water.",
	"a9": "[say]You observe Leitzka opening the fridge to produce two baked hams and proceeds to cut slices from them, preparing food. <- Of note, these baked hams have been on short supply in stores due to produciton goals changing from hams to sausages, which means that this foodstuff may not have been bought from local industry. This would mean they got it at an Intershop selling Western goods, but the price of each foodstuff does not quite match the amount of money paid to Hassel. Leitzka is currently not gainfully employed either. So the origin of these two portions of ham is not explained by the current circumstances.",
	"a10": "[say]You observe Leitzka turn on the radio and start drinking coffee, Cuban.",
	"a11": "[say]You observe Leitzka leave the kitchen and go into the hallway where there are no cameras to continue surveillance, analysis of the noises from audio match normal bathroom bodily activities. Audio analysis is difficult due to the sound of the radio drowning out the unseen activity.",
	"a12": "[say]You observe Leitzka continues to be away from camera view, presumably having left the bathroom and stay in one of the two bedrooms of the residence. Audio analysis is inconclusive as to what she is doing, again, due to the sound of the radio in the kitchen. <- Common activity of citizens, whether on direct surveillance or not is to attempt to drown out their noises beneath the sounds of radio and television. This practice could be of note on a subject for subversion.",
	"a13": "[say]The door opens on the camera feed pointing to the living room, in comes another individual, presumably Mr. Hassel. \"Albert?\" Leitzka asks from a room that is not in view of the surveillance equipment. \"Yes Nadine, it's me.\" the man answers. Confirmed the individual to be Albert Hassel.",
	"a14": "[say]You observe Hassel greet Lietzka, take his coat off and leave it by one of two sofas in the living room. <- This is non-standard, however Hassel's dossier does denote that he did buy off a certain cadre of items from a friend who moved away to [REDACTED] on assignment. One of these items might be the sofa.",
	"a15": "[say]You observe Hassel sit on the sofa, relaxing his belt buckle. \"Could you turn that thing off, Nadine? I grow tired of the same shrill voice saying the same things over and over.\" Lietzka complies, and turns the radio off. Audio analysis is no longer a challenge. <- Manifest dislike of newscaster may be a small but concrete sign of dissatisfaction, not enough to signal acitonable offenses, but tells of his state of mind.",
	"a16": "[say]\"So,\" Lietzka inquires. \"Have you gotten anything back from State Security? You know, for the exit visas?\" ",
	"a17": "[say]\"Ugh,\" Hassel grunts. \"No, let's not talk about that right now Nadine. I have had enough with Gerhart's prodding and pulling and all these-- these little grubby things that get in the way of accomplishing anything in a single day of work.\" Lietzka stands by the kitchen door, arms crossed. She is not satisfied with Hassel's evasive answer. After a brief moment of silence, Lietzka storms off to the kitchen, throws the meal on a plate, then comes back to the living room and slams it in front of Hassel on the living room table. The noise is very sharp. It stings to hear through the headphones.",
	"a18": "[say]\"Could you have a tantrum with your own belongings, Nadine? You know, instead of mine?\" Hassel chides, as he grabs the plate and a fork to eat.",
	"a19": "[say]\"I don't believe I asked you about that grubby boss of yours, Albert. I don't want to think about that man's smell of week-old tobacco.\" Leitzka snarls back. \"I am asking about exit visas, for you, and me. I have been asking for exit visas for three months now. Laurie from a floor above only had to wait for a month, Albert. Quite frankly I don't understand why am I more upset than you, since the Ministry is clearly interrogating your... kindergarden teacher or something.\"",
	"a20": "[say]Hassel sighs in exasperation, and speaks in between chews. \"Look, I don't know what to tell you. I have gone to my nearest State Security Office, you know, the one by the movie theater?\" Lietzka nods in agreement. \"Been going three times a day since I put in the papers to get exit visas. The man at the door already knows me by name, for God's sake. And it's always the same answer, no matter what.\"",
	"a21": "[say]\"Your petition is currently being reviewed by Security authorities, an ongoing petition is not a subsitute for a visa.\" Nadine recites as if out of a prayer book.",
	"a22": "[say]\"Clearly a you are a spitting image of the comrade.\" Hassel gets up and pecks Leitzka with a kiss. \"But on a much closer appraisal, you are much better looking.\"",
	"a23": "[say]Leitzka chuckles as she pulls a chair from the kitchen to sit at a ninety-degree angle from Hassel. \"Oh you, don't say that,\" she says in a playful tone \"at this point saying any party member is less than an Adonis might be a crime and... you never know who's listening.\"",
	"a24": "[say]\"I don't know what is with the Ministry,\" He says, returning the couch to finish his plate. \"I ask for something that I have a right to ask for. I have never done or said anything against doctrine. I attend every meeting of my local chapter, I am a volunteer tutor for the school... I may not be a chipper beaver inside the Party, but I haven't done anything wrong either! Security's just run by a nut job. As it always has.\" <- Subversive attitude against the State apparatus detected. ",
	"a25": "[say]\"Don't lie, Albert.\" Leitzka says. \"It's not every single Party meeting.\"",
	"a26": "[say]\"Well, neither does Laurie's husband. No, no, h-he-he gets his things the old fashioned way, from a cousin of someone up in Border Troops high command. It's all the same everywhere, all the time. Some Party we got, eh.\" Hassel, says.",
	"a27": "[say]Leitzka mouths something that is not visible to the camera, nor loud enough to make out.",
	"a28": "[say]\"Let's watch some television, Nadine. Ok?\" Hassel says as you observe him reach out to Leitzka's shoulder, she responds leaning into him.",
	"a29": "[say]You observe both of them sit on the sofa and turn on the television set. They watch television in silence for the following two hours, without much to note or observe.",
	"a30": "[say]You observe Hassel break the silence. \"I wish you'd tell me what's the rush in getting an exit visa. I know it's important, but these things th-the-they take time.\" ",
	"a31": "[say]\"I hope you're not one of those tattletale stooges in the Party who tell on every Dick and Jane in hopes to get a promotion. You're in too deep for that. I just want to leave in the same train you do.\"",
	"a32": "[say]You observe that after this conversation, Hassel does not say a word. Neither does Leitzka. They both retire to their rooms, with no further activity of note.",
	"a33": "[say]#### Day 2",
	"a34": "[say]Surveillance start at 0500 hours on Wednesday, March 10th.",
	"a35": "[say]Hassel wakes up at 0630 hours, followed by Lietzka shortly thereafter.",
	"a36": "[say]You observe subjects Lietzka and Hassel exchange pleasentries over breakfast prepared by Lietzka. From the objects obserbed to be taken from the refrigerator, it is an egg-based breakfast. More to follow. Casual conversation follows, over the morning radio broadcast. ",
	"a37": "[say]At around 0730, you observe a phone call is made to Hassel's residence. Previous surveillance indicates the call is from The People's Electronics Fabricant, approximately 700 meters away from the Hassel surveillance site, Hassel's workplace. On the other line is Hassel's boss, citizen Gerhart Kleiner, Head of Day-Shift Production. The conversation is as follows:",
	"a38": "[say]Hassel (H): This is Albert Hassel, number HXT9115. To who am I speaking?",
	"a39": "[say]Kleiner (K): Yes, Hassel. This is Kleiner, I need to speak to you about the papers you submitted for a promotion. I don't know what dirt you have on that blowhard Mayer, but it worked. You will be promoted to Engineer Team Lead, beginning next semester. ",
	"a40": "[say]H: Ah, Mr. Kleiner! That is the best news I have heard in a long time.",
	"a41": "[say]K: Yeah, yeah. Probably you should start packing but not quickly, who knows when Housing is going to assign you your new flat. Even though they should. Don't get too comfortable though, the Party is breathing down my neck.",
	"a42": "[say]H: How so?",
	"a43": "[say]K: Well, you haven't been a good enough boy, Hassel. What do you want me to say? You're a no-show at your local Party meetings, and even if you say you tutor children as volunteer work that's not going to be enough in your new position. You know, they might actually block your promotion if you don't show your face around at least.",
	"a44": "[say]H: Oh c'mon Kleiner, a man's got to have some peace and quiet! I get back home, and I have cook my meals, sweep my floors... I got things to do other than sit every week for two or three hours to hear some patsy from Berlin-",
	"a45": "[say]K: Don't you be starting now, you never know who's listening. At any rate, the Party wants your face in their offices as soon as possible. Have something to hand them, anything will do.",
	"a46": "[say]H: That how you got ahead Mr. Keliner? Making stuff up and hoping nobody catches on?",
	"a47": "[say]K: I swear to God boy, it's like you're begging to be taken away. I am not answering that.",
	"a48": "[say]H: My mistake, my mistake. I got some legitimate to show at the Party offices so I'll pop over there after I'm done working.",
	"a49": "[say]K: Nah, we're so close to *meeting* our production quotas for the year it isn't worth it to even turn on the machines. Leadership decided to give the day off to everyone, and I'd rather save you the nasty surprise of coming to the factory to an empty floor. It's probably going to take you the whole day at the Party offices anyway.",
	"a50": "[say]H: Really? How is everyone else going to know the factory's closed?",
	"a51": "[say]K: Does that sound like my problem, Hassel? I am giving you a courtesy call, that should be enough for you.",
	"a52": "[say]H: That's fine Kleiner, always a pleasure talking to you and thank you for the heads up.",
	"a53": "[say]Before hanging up, the microphone on the phone picks up Hassel muttering \"Little tyrant...\" <- Prospect for a promotion does not really reflect a subersive element for the intergity of the State.",
	"a54": "[say]You observe Lietzka take notice of the conversation that just transpired. \"Good news, from the looks of it.\" She comments.",
	"a55": "[say]Hassel sits down and takes a bite of his nondescript breakfast. \"Uhm, yes. Looks like I will be getting a promotion come June. Before that I have to make good with the Party. If I show up we might actually see those exit visas, finally.\" He responds.",
	"a56": "[say]\"Well that's dandy.\" Lietzka says. This is the first time you have observed her smile since coming across her dossier and surveillance started. \"I guess you and that Gerhart made like thieves with the production numbers, if they're so good they're giving off holidays like they were bargains.\" She comments. <- Lying about meeting production quotas is a serious offense and classifed as a cause for sedition accusations. However, the investigation to prove subversion to the state through industry will not suffice the needs of the surveillance investigation.",
	"a57": "[say]\"For once, woud it kill you to be happy for me Nadine?\" Hassel says, with a tinge of annoyance. \"We have our numbers, everyone at the factory gets a new thing to put on their tables, and for once we're producing what we actually need to produce instead of brand new boards just sitting in warehouses where they won't go anywhere.  Hon-hon-honestly, it frustrates me to no end seeing something I worked so hard on sit there doing... nothing. If there is a surplus of demand, then the market will adjust if it can't go anywhere.\"",
	"a58": "[say]Leitzka smirks. \"I see you've been reading lover-boy.\" ",
	"a59": "[say]Hassel chuckles. \"Hey, it doesn't hurt to take a leaf from their book every now and then.\"",
	"a60": "[say]Leitzka laughs lightly at that remark.",
	"a61": "[say]Hassel finishes his breakfast and starts to walk out the door. \"I will be gone probably all day, so don't wait for me. You could visit Laurie, actually. You told me you enjoy her company.\" ",
	"a62": "[say]Leitzka looks dejected. \"Yes, I guess...\" Hassel then leaves the flat and exits the building. ",
	"a63": "[say]You phone the Party offices near Hassel's residence to send a Telefax to report his arrival. You give instructions to retain him as much as possible, for as long as possible. Party offices acknowledge the message, and will comply with the needs of the investigation. It's always nice when other people do your tedious work for you, in silence and contemplation.",
	"a64": "[say]You observe Letizka is the only person in the apartment. You observe her sit on the living room sofa and pull out a briefcase from under it. She opens it and starts shuffling around its contents. She ponders on a couple of items for a long period of time. From the faint noises you hear through the surveillance microphones, it seems that she is crying over the contents of this briefcase. ",
	"a65": "[say]You hear faint whispers, \"One day, one day, one day\" in between the sobs.",
	"a66": "[say]After around thirty minutes of silence and cotemplation, Leitzka puts the briefcase back under the sofa and leaves the flat.",
	"a67": "[say]Surveillance around the building, provided by the same Field Office, indicates that she did not visit her neighbor Laurie Weiss.One of the other agents in the Field Office noticed that she instead she decided to sit down at the nearby park and playground and pass the time in silence there. A perfect time to improve the surveillance equipment on the premises, and search for any materials that could build a case for the investigation. ",
	"a68": "[say]You phone the local Coordination Office and ask for a team of surveillance setups at the earliest notice. The operation has the approval from Bayer to be top priority, so they assemble who they can and send them to you. In a matter of 10 minutes, you can hear the sirens of a modified fire truck, with a distinct variation in alarm pattern, meaning it's a Stasi covert car. Ten seconds later, the team knocks on the door of the Field Office, and present themselves to you, ready to work.",
	"a69": "[say]Enter the flat.",
	"a70": "[say]The surveillance team enters the flat. At your direction, they install cameras in the remaining two bedrooms of the flat. As it happens, the map you were given was incorrect, and there is only one additional room that is not surveyed, and a bathroom that is not surveyed. Construction of the flat don't make it feasible to incorporate additional cameras without concelament in a reasonable amount of time, more microphones are placed in using the wires of existing equipment. On the living room there are two objects of interest. A book on top of the coffee table, and the briefcase Leitzka had taken from under the sofa.",
	"a71": "[say]Look at the book: The cover seems to indicate a perfectly normal cooking book, but one the dust jacket is removed, the true contents reveal themselves to be Freedom of Nations by Adam Smith. <- Hiding the contents of a published work is suspicious enough, the fact that it is western propaganda is even more disturbing. The publisher house on the first page of the cover is from a company in the West. This was clearly not produced here, nor was it authorized for sell in the Intershops. This is posession of unauthorized public goods.",
	"a72": "[say]Look at the briefcase: The briefcase reveals itself to be an assortments of various knick knacks of personal siginficance to Leitzka. On top of the pile, two items of interest. You snap a picture for the evidence file.",
	"a73": "[say]A picture: A faded, sepia tone picture of a woman holding two children. The picture seems to have been taken some time ago. You take out a pocket camera and snap a picture that will record what the photo is. Given that the picture was still somewhat warm, this is most likely the object Nadine Lietzka was crying over. <- Further nalysis should uncover who these people are and how are they relevant to Lietzka.",
	"a74": "[say]A scribbled map: A hastily scribbled diagram which is some sort of map on slight aged graphing paper. It seem to indicate a series of roads and sewer tunnels. You take out a pocket camera and snap a picture of that diagram. <- Sending the diagram for analysis should ellucidate what is this location referring to.",
	"a75": "[say]You return the objects to their previous state and exit the premises with care to not have been seen inside or leave any trace of yourselves. ",
	"a76": "[say]Several hours later, Hassel returns to the flat with a package under his arm and places it on the kitchen table. Cameras are not able to distinguish who is the package for or what it contains. <- Subjects under direct surveillance of the Ministry of State Safety are by policy not allowed to recieve any mail unless already examined and reported to the acting surveillance Agent. This is a break in procedure.",
	"a77": "[say]You phone in immediately to Division XIX to ask for a status report.",
	"a78": "[say]Division XIX reports no parcels were addressed to Albert Hassel or Nadine Leitzka therefore there was nothing to intercept. ",
	"a79": "[say]Nadine Leitzka does not return until late in the evening, after Hassel had already eaten and gone to bed. You do not detect any night time activities between the two of them.",
	"a80": "[say]#### Day 3",
	"a81": "[say]Surveillance start at 0500 hours on Thursday, March 11th.",
	"a82": "[say]At around 0600, you observe a phone call is made to Hassel's residence. The phone ring wakes up Hassel and Leitzka, forcing Hassel to get out of bed earlier than previously observed. Previous surveillance indicates the call is from The People's Electronics Fabricant, approximately 700 meters away from the Hassel surveillance site, Hassel's workplace. On the other line is Hassel's boss, citizen Gerhart Kleiner, Head of Day-Shift Production. The conversation is as follows:",
	"a83": "[say]Hassel (H): Who in the hell is ca-",
	"a84": "[say]Kleiner (K): It's me you idiot. Did you fuck the Party official's wife or something?",
	"a85": "[say]H: W-what?",
	"a86": "[say]K: Did. You. Fuck. The. Party. Official's. Wife? Answer me!",
	"a87": "[say]H: No, no! Of course not, Kleiner! Why would you even ask me that?",
	"a88": "[say]K: I got called to meet to my local Party secretary in the dead of night last night. He was angry, Keliner. That I would pick you to lead the Engineering team. He said that you have no loyalty. Not to the Party, not to the country... So again, I ask, as politely as I can, what did you do?!",
	"a89": "[say]H: I sat there for five hours then spoke to the official about my tutoring work, what else was I supposed to do?",
	"a90": "[say]K: Well, they must have mistaken you for some other Hassel, because they're come down on me now. If I don't drop you as the Lead next semester they will come and investigate me, you, and everyone and everything else at the factory. I don't know why you talked me into reducing the output to meet what we sold. I should have never listen-",
	"a91": "[say]H: I talked you into it? Dear God, Kleiner don't you start lying now. We decided on it, remember?",
	"a92": "[say]K: No, no. No, no, no. You -- ",
	"a93": "[say]Kleiner grunts angrily, blowing off steam.",
	"a94": "[say]K: You're lucky, damn lucky, to keep your job. Forget about a promotion, as long as you're working under me you'll be staying where you are and you can sit with the bag of shit the Party drops on you. Count me out of it.",

	"a96": "[say]K: No! No! I have no part in it. Also, don't bother showing up today -- or the rest of the week for that matter. Just don't show up.",
	"a97": "[say]H: Kleiner? Kleiner! I swear I didn't do-",
	"a98": "[say]The phone call is over from Kleiner's side of the line.",
	"a99": "[say]You observe that while the call was taking place, some activity is heard in the bedroom. A bag being zipped open, what seems like clothes being stuffed in a bag, and the bag zipped shut. ",
	"a100": "[say]\"GOD-DAMN-IT!\" You observe Hassel scream as he slams the phone on the cradle. The noise it makes through the speakers forces you to wince. ",
	"a101": "[say] You observe Lietzka emerge from the hallway in sleeping clothes, rubbing her eyes. \"Maybe you want to be louder to make sure you wake up everyone in the block, Albert.\" she says in between a yawn.",
	"a102": "[say]Hassel pays no mind to this remark and goes back through the hallway, presumably to get dressed. Audio information indicates this, and he emerges from the hallway again hastily dressed in a wrinkled shirt and pants.",
	"a103": "[say]\"I have to run to the Party headquerters and set this right, Nadine.\" He says in a hurried tone. \"Everything has gone wrong, I don't think they have the right Albert Hassel. This is terrible, Nadine. Terrible.\"",
	"a104": "[say]You observe Hassel grab the suspicious package observed yesterday and hand it over to Lietzka. \"Here,\" he says. \"this came in the mail for you. I don't recall you had told anyone that you had moved in with me, but it seems our dear government knows everything before I do.\" ",
	"a105": "[say]You observe Nadine taking the package. It is notable that she does not seem surprised or phased by the package's appearance, suggesting she was expecting it already. <- The suspicious package unaccounted for by Division XIX was sent to Nadine. ",
	"a106": "[say]Hessel goes in for a kiss on the cheek to Leitzka, something she rebuffs by looking away. Hassel's tone gets increasingly despondent. \"So that's how it's going to be now, is it? Even you are going to abandon me the moment things go wrong?\" ",
	"a107": "[say]Leitzka scoffs. You observe her going to the living room, grabbing the book on top of the coffee table and cradle it like a baby. \"I am starting to think that trusting you is not such a good idea, Albert. And I wish you didn't give me more reasons to believe that.\" ",
	"a108": "[say]\"I don't believe this,\" you observe Hassel say with a tone of exasperation. \"N-n-no, I-I don't believe this at all.\" He shuts the door and presses himself against Leitzka in a clear attempt to assert dominance. By the way she winces, it's safe to assume that Leitzka did not expect this reaction. ",
	"a109": "[say]\"You think I'm playing, Nadine?\" he asks \"You think I'm p-p-pretending or s-something? That I like that this is happening? It may come as a surprise to you, but I don't.

	"a113": "[say]You observe Hassel walk out the door and close it with a smash. Again, the noise makes you wince as you hear it's full blast in the headphones. You briefly take off your headphones and call the Party official at the headquarters he had visited before to instruct the same holding procedure as before. This time, to seed information about the exit visa. For now, let us say that approval will be provisionally granted on grounds of good behavior, but to expect additional duties to the State in the future should he want to conserve his standing. ",

	"a117": "[say]About ten seconds later, you observe that the wire tap comes alive again, as Leitzka has another conversation. From context clues, you cannot really tell who is on the other side. Previous surveillance does not report that Leitzka has any friends or family in state to contact besides Hassel, and the person on the phone sounds nothing like him. The inerlocutor sounds like an older woman, in her fourties, with some kind of throat issue. She will be designated as Anonymous:",

You turn to the camera at the front of the building to record the identity of this \"Sonia.\" No activity of note is observed in the next fifteen minutes, beyond the kettle whistling in Hassel's kitchen.",
	"a133": "[say]You ask around in the Field Office if they had any concealed camera equipment on board, but the silence that followed your inquiry confirmed that there wasn't any. You curse your lack of preparedness for this moment. Usually State Security's intel is more or less airtight.",
	"a134": "[say]You observe an oddly clothed person go up to the porch, and press the buzzer that corresponds to Hassel's flat. Presumably, this \"Sonia\" person. An electric buzz lets her in, without you being able to take a picture of this person. What a shame.",

You observe Leitzka starting to address her, but you clearly observe this person stopping her with a hand gesture, and at the same time turn on a radio loudly. <- Evasive tactics means this person suspects being followed or monitored.",
	"a136": "[say]Luckily for you, the upgrade on surveillance in Hassel's apartments provided the coverage you needed to hear them even above the racket that Bluejay had created. Nothing escapes the eyes of the State.",
	"a137": "[say]\"Ma-\" Nadine starts",
	"a138": "[say]\"Child, must I remind you to not use names among us in an unsecure location?\" The strange individual responds, in a voice similar to the \"Sonia\" on the phone. This individual is covered head to toe in dark-colored clothes, oddly wrapped up for Spring. She has not taken off her long-brimmed hat either, making identification a challenge.",
	"a139": "[say]\"Ok, ok. Sonia, I don't know what to do.\" Leitzka concedes. Confirming the unknown party is the \"Sonia\" in the previous phone conversation.",
	"a140": "[say]\"You knew what the risks were beforehand, Ladybird.\" Sonia chides. \"I remember offering you a better alternative, but you decided to do it your way.\"",
	"a141": "[say]\"I'm aware, Sonia. I thought his remembering me in school was something to captialize on. I mean, look around, does it look like he was going to be any trouble?\" Letizka responds.",
	"a142": "[say]\"Oh I can see, Ladybird.\" Sonia says, in between sips of a cup of tea. \"All that is gold does not glitter-\"",
	"a143": "[say]\"-and not all those who wander are lost.\" Leitzka responds, completing a phrase. \"I remember that book like a lightning in a bottle. Of course, not every part.\"",
	"a144": "[say]\"Yes, yes. I believe I gave you that one and others.\" Sonia says. \"But, I believe it's time to be decisive. You can always come back to the fold. We need people like you. You know he'd like it, we would too.\" ",
	"a145": "[say]A brief silence falls in the room. ",
	"a146": "[say]\"Th-then are you sure? Do you know I can see them again?\" Nadine says, barely above a whisper that the microphone could pick up over the racket. ",
	"a147": "[say]On this question, Sonia downs her cup of chamomille tea and turns down the radio, removing the racket making surveillance challenging. \"You know what to do, love. The rest is up to you.\"",
	"a148": "[say]With this statement, Sonia stands up, and leaves the apartment. You scramble to at least get a good look at this woman before she becomes a dead end in the investigation. Leaving your post would be ill advised at this point in the investigation but you risk leaving a significative loose end.",
	"a149": "[say]Option A",
	"a150": "[say]You leave the Field Office as quietly as you can to have a smoke outside the flats and catch a glimpse of this character. Surely enough, twenty seconds later you observe this oddly dressed woman leave the building. Her wide brimmed hat obscures the view, most likely a luxury item from the Intershop. Definitely in her forties, with caked on makeup, tired brown eyes, and pursed lips. She walks past you as you draw on a cigarrette, your lungs catching on fire. You had not picked up the habit, and it took every fiber of your being not to start a coughing fit there and then. As she turned around the corner, you cough like a chimney, go back into  the Field Office, sketch her likeness and enter it into the archive. (should carry big risk / big reward clue)",
	"a151": "[say]Option B",
	"a152": "[say]Writing only the presence of this Sonia in the report you keep on listening what happens in the Hassel flat. The Field Office puts in a word through Telex to inquire about a Sonia in the archives of the Ministry connected to Nadine Leitzka. There is a strong likelihood in the use of code names to further confuse proceedings, but that will have to wait. You observe Leitzka washing the teacup used by Sonia, and resume housework duties. ",
	"a153": "[say]Nothing suspicious to observe and report for the next couple of hours.",
	"a154": "[say]A phone call from the Party Office notifies you that Hassel has left the premises and is likely to return to the flats.",
	"a155": "[say]He does not do so for at least 90 minutes more. ",
	"a156": "[say]You observe Hassel entering the building, with a bags of groceries. This would explain his extended absence. However, you don't observe him enter his flat. Instead, he has gone somewhere else within the building.",
	"a157": "[say]Fearing the worst of losing track of Hassel, you commandeer the rest of the surveillance equipment within the Field Office, you search for a screen. Any screen that could tell you where Hassel is. ",
	"a158": "[say]Sure enough, he is two floors above his flat, exchanging pleasantries with a neighbor. The image is grainy but you see him exchanging something and recieving another thing in return. <- Clue",
	"a159": "[say]The Field Office had not maintained surveillance lines properly there, so there was no way to record or observe the resulting conversation.",
	"a160": "[say]You observe Hassel move away from view, and descend two floors to enter his flat, to be greeted by Leitzka.",
	"a161": "[say]\"So, it truly seems to be an honest mistake what happened.\" He says triumphantly.",
	"a162": "[say]\"Oh. is that so?\" Leitzka asks, nonchalant. It's clear Lietzka does not belive Hassel.",
	"a163": "[say]\"Many a man can save himself if he admits he's done wrong and takes his punishment, as Ibsen would say.\" Hassel says, jubilant. \"Even the great Party tars and feathers the wrong man once in a blue moon, how auspicious that it would be me... and you!\" You observe that Hassel has not understood that he is not trusted.",
	"a164": "[say]\"Me?\" Letizka asks, again with little energy. \"Why would they want anything to do with me?\"",
	"a165": "[say]\"Well,\" Hassel responds, putting on airs. \"they were asking me not so much about my business, but yours, Nadine. They ask me why am I intending to leave the country with another person that's not my spouse. And I say, 'isn't that quite normal?' The party putz says 'no, it is not.' So it was you after all, dear! It was you! Sounds like someone needs to show face over there. So, guess what I said. Go on, guess.\" Hassel decidedly expects enthusiasm where there simply isn't any from Leitzka. She says nothing.",
	"a166": "[say]\"I said, that we were not married... yet!\" Hassel says in between laughs.",
	"a167": "[say]You observe Leitzka react harshly to this retort, she drops the plate she was washing right into the sink, causing a crashing sound that might just burst your eardrums.",
	"a168": "[say]\"You're saying you... you... want to-\" Leitzka starts to ask in a much different tone.",
	"a169": "[say]\"Oh good heavens, it's a bit early to be saying that seriously Nadine. But if the lady herself wants to leave, this gentleman is only too willing to bend the truth for her benefit. That's all it takes Nadine, that's all it takes. And we get to leave on holiday!\" Hassel hollers. Leitzka has no answer to give.",
	"a170": "[say]After a brief and awkward silence, you observe Hassel trying to curry Leitzka's favor \"Oh come on, darling. Even you have to admit that's ingenious, hm?\" Leitzka responds with a silent nod, and remains motionless as Hassel embraces her.",
	"a171": "[say]Lietzka finishes with housework and eat dinner with chitchat that is not relevant to the investigation. ",
	"a172": "[say]Later that evening, they retire to Hassel's chamber where the microphone audio suggests undressing and the noises and grunts halmark of a prelude to copulation. ",
	"a173": "[say]You hear Leitzka ask \"Say Albert, if you got the visa tonight and... you could go anywhere. Where would you go? ",
	"a174": "[say]Hassel responds \"Well, I'd love to go away... but not too far. Can't get ahead of ourselves, can't get greedy. How about a nice beach in Riga, hm? To Riga, you still need a visa to go, but not that many checkpoints after that.\"",
	"a175": "[say]\"Riga? That's... Latvia, right?\" Leitzka asks after a brief silence.",
	"a176": "[say]\"Really good place, I've heard. Worth visting after a good year of work.\" He says.",
	"a177": "[say]\"Albert, I... I am not in the mood. Not anymore. Sorry\" Lietzka whispers.",
	"a178": "[say]\"Really?\" Hassel says, a tone of mockery in his voice. \"You get me all hot and bothered and you lose all your moxie at Latvia?\"",
	"a179": "[say]\"I w-was forcing myself, really. I knew you had a bad going these past few days I wanted to give you something.\" Nadine says with tinge of nervousness.",
	"a180": "[say]\"Oh darling, You shouldn't do that. I'm in the mood, t-t-though that's fine. That's fine. You know what, that's ok. That's f-f-fine.\" Hassel responds, first annoyed, then conciliatory. \"Let's just sleep then, I have deal with that bastard Kleiner tomorrow.\"",
	"a181": "[say]No more activity to report past this hour.",
	"a182": "[say]### Day 4",
	"a183": "[say]Surveillance starts at 0500 hours on Friday, March 12th.",
	"a184": "[say]In the early morning you get a report from Division XIX that there was no veto on file for the gag placed on Hassel and Letizka for that package that had arrived on Wednesday the 10th. ",
	"a185": "[say]Nobody in the Division even had a a record of the package in question, which was extremely surprising considering that the surveillance operation had started at a higher level in the chain-of-command than usual State Security work on suspects for sedition and dessertion. The package may have been sent before the gag order, but the package would have at least have had a record of recipt and transfer at the local Post Office, a record that should not have been expugned since those last up to three months. Nobody dropped the package personally, since that would have been caught on surveillance, and the person who would do it immediately detained and interrogated. ",
	"a186": "[say]Which meant that somebody within either the structure of the Ministry or the Party itself made sure to deliver the package without any tracking or tracing. <- Clue",
	"a187": "[say]You observe at 0530 hours unusual rummaging at this particular time from the bedchambers. Shortly after you see Leitzka hauling around a suitcase to the living room, opening it to get a few books. She rearranges its contents in a hasty manner, and proceeds to stuff the package she obtained in the suitcase. She is at flight risk and leave the reach of immediate surveillance. ",
	"a188": "[say]You start to phone in for a State Security squad when you hear Hassel calling from the bed chambers. \"Nadine, Nadine, where are you?\"",
	"a189": "[say]\"In the kitchen, Albert. I thought I'd make breakfast.\" Leitzka responds in a hurried tone, and closes her suitcase.",
	"a190": "[say]\"Ah, are you? I don't think I hear any cooking noises, though.\" Hassel yells from the bedroom.",
	"a191": "[say]\"I just started Albert, sorry to have woken you up.\" Leitzka says, hurrying to the kitchen and turning on the stove and assembling breakfast foods. The suitcase she was putting together is sitting atop of the sofa. As you observe her perparing food, you make the phone call to have an arrest squad stand at the ready.",
	"a192": "[say]Thirty minutes later, Hassel joins Leitzka at the kitchen and sits down for breakfast, they exchange small talk about nothing in particular that is subject to the investigation. Leitzka is evasive and curt with her responses, a textbook case of flight risk from surveillance.",
	"a193": "[say]You observe Hassel inquire Leitzka about a vacation. \"Say Nadine, what agrees with you more dear? Summer, or autumn?\"",
	"a194": "[say]\"I don't understand your question, Albert.\" She says barely audible above a whisper.",
	"a195": "[say]\"Summer or autumn, which one do you like best? I'm asking for the trip to Riga.\" Albert says in between mouthfuls of food. \"See, I hear Riga is nice for either but you might hate the sunshine and the people in summer.\"",
	"a196": "[say]\"Me... the sunshine? Is that what you want to ask me?\" Lietzka asks, with a tone of incredulity.",
	"a197": "[say]\"Of course! We're going since that whole aff-aff-affair with State Security is over, they told me the exit visas would be ready in no time. No time at all.\" Hassel says with a cheery tune.",
	"a198": "[say]\"But, you don't *have* them do you? You didn't actually get documents, right?\" Leitzka says with an even greater sneer.",
	"a199": "[say]\"Why would they tell me otherwise Nadine? I don't get your questions, honestly.\" Hassel responds, dismissively.",
	"a200": "[say]Lietzka sits up and after a brief silence she responds, \"I don't believe this. You actually trust them, don't you?\" She says.",
	"a201": "[say]\"They look out for us, Nadine. Sometimes they might be a bit unpallatable or brutish, but it's all well and good.\" Hassel says, with a bit more firmness. ",
	"a202": "[say]Lietzka starts laughing in response. First a bit softly, then raising up in volume to a sort of cackle. This has Hassel stunned since you observe he has stopped moving or speaking. After she's done cackling, she breathes in heavily and stands up. \"Enjoy your breakfast, Albert. I'm not hungry anymore.\" she says before going back to the bed chamber.",
	"a203": "[say]\"Wait, wait, w-wait. Nadine? Wh-where are you going?\" Hassel inquires with a tinge of nervousness.",
	"a204": "[say]Leitzka doesn't respond until she emerges from the halway, dressed up. \"A couple of days ago, I asked myself. Now I know. I can't really trust you, Albert. Can't trust you to keep to yourself, can't trust you to do something righ, I can't even trust you to have thoughts made on your own.\"",
	"a205": "[say]\"What's that supposed to mean? What is all this out of the blue, Nadine?\" Hassel asks, increasingly incensed.",
	"a206": "[say]\"Do I have to spell it out for you lover-boy?\" Nadine responds, standing by the hallway entry. ",
	"a207": "[say]Hassel, enraged, stands up from the kitchen and confronts Leitzka.",
	"a208": "[say]\"Perhaps I made a mistake of my own,\" Albert  says \"because I really trusted you. I truly did.\" This gets a surprise out of Leitzka. \"I thought finding you was an act of divine providence, I got to see the girl I loved when I was just a scholboy and do all the things I desperately wanted to do back then. I should have know better -- better than to allow you to live with me.\"",
	"a209": "[say]Leitzka truns around without saying a word and dissappears out of the camera frame. \"Yes, Nadine. Please! Run away, run away like you always do. Like you do in your 'visits to the cafeteria'. I asked the cashier about you to make small talk, and you would never guess what happened? She has never heard of you! Ever! I just assumed you went out of your way to go to another coffee shop I don't know about, silly me! I asked Laurie about you, and she said you had not seen each other in three months! Sily me, maybe we are talking about different Lauries, convenient!\" Hassel lashes out. <- Leitzka covertly leaves the flat without a known destination.",
	"a210": "[say]\"Oh God, don't speak that woman's name in my presence again, Albert! That woman has a wet sponge for a brain!\" Leitzka snaps back from a location away form the cameras, presumably the bedroom they both share. ",
	"a211": "[say]\"Shout it louder, dear!\" Hassel responds. \"Who knows who is listening, it might be her!\" ",
	"a212": "[say]Lietzka comes into the living room again and slaps Hassel across the face. You observe Hassel taken aback, completely caught off guard. A brief silence is exchanged between the two of them.",
	"a213": "[say]\"I-I-I'm leaving, Albert. We're through. I wish I had never given you my book to read, or my pamphlets for that m-matter. When you walk out that door, and go see your party w-whatever, I will have left. Yes... yes. I will have left\" Leitzka stammered through that, but as she kept deliniating her plans, she became resolute. <- Wealth of Nations copy is owned by Nadine Leitzka.",
	"a214": "[say]You observe Hassel staring at her, and they exchange another brief silence. Hassel's facial expressions are not intelligible through the camera, but it is a safe bet he is processing Leitzka's words. \"The moment I saw those leaflets from United Left I should have dropped you at the police station. But, I will keep my silence, and I should caution you to keep yours.\" He finally says coldly. <- Hassel did not report Leitzka, however Leitzka is in the posession of directly subversive literature.",
	"a215": "[say]\"You know, I had it all planned out for us,\" Hassel says softly, just above the threshold for microphone pick up. \"No,\" Leitzka responds \"not far enough. Not nearly far enough. I thought we could leave, together. But you're afraid, too afraid. And, I don't blame you.\"",
	"a216": "[say]You observe Leitzka taking a deep breath.",
	"a217": "[say]\"If you saw what I see for the future, it would scare you.\" <- Leitzka quoted Josip Tito.",
	"a218": "[say]You observe Leitzka appearing again on camera, leaving through the front door of the flat and out into the street. Flight risk measures are activated, and are now directed to apprehend her in a 3 block radius of the flats.",
	"a219": "[say]Alone in his apartment Hassel starts destroying his belongings, loudly crashing and banging everything he can see. It's quite annoying to listen to, let alone observe  \"Nadine! Nadine!\" He screams. Of course, nobody responds.",
	"a220": "[say]After approximately an hour later, his belongings mostly broken or dented, he sits on the sofa in silence, and opens a cabinet next to him. Form it he produces a cigarrette pack, a lighter, and a small porcelain dish. You observe him light up a cigarrette and smoke it in silence.",
	"a221": "[say]After finishing his cigarrette, you observe him pick up the phone and let it produce the open line tone. He starts speaking into the telephone as if somebody was on the other line, when there isn't. His breath is labored, presumably from the cigarrette he just smoked.",
	"a222": "[say]Hassel: Are you listening? Of course you are, you are the State Security. Are you enjoying this? Did you watch me an Nadine going at it? Did you watch us eat breakfast and watch television? I hope it was worth it, I hope you got something out of it as much as you did you damn perverts. Always looking, always watching, I do wonder when did I catch your attention. Was it when she came in the apartment? Was it when she gave me that book to read? You know something, I loved it. I loved reading about, I loved reading about how you could actually make something out of yourself instead of being a bug under the thumb made by a million bureaucrats. I work, and I work.... and I work until I'm a ragged doll and I will get a scoop of mud and a punch to the head for my troubles. But it's not enough is it? It's not enough for you, you also have to drink from my cup and eat from my plate, and watch me, watch me, watch us all take a dump, fall in love, have a thought. Watch us forever. Nadine wanted to leave so bad... Maybe I'd like to go too... To a place you can't find me, you can't watch me, you can't hear me you... You --hnnng-- f-f-f-fffuck-fucking professional perverts in the Stasi. Fuck you, fuck you all to hell.",
	"a223": "[say]The one-sided conversation ended there.",
	"a224": "[say]You put in a word at the local constabularies for the detainment of Albert Hassel should he exit a 30 meter perimeter from the flats. He is also at flight risk, and you phone the State Security constabulary to assemble a squad for Hassel's detainment should he attempt to leave the premises.",
	"a225": "[say]At 0915 hours, you recieve confirmation of the preliminary detainment of Nadine Leitzka. She is being held in a low-risk cell at Hohenschönhausen. Which is perfect since that's the end of surveillance operations. Given that both of the subjects of surveillance have order for detention, cover surveillance is no longer advisable nor necessary.  You take your last notes and start putting together the case files.",
	"a226": "[say]You give orders to the Field Office to detain Hassel if he attempts to leave the premises, and to detain him anyway if he didn't come out of his flat in two hours time. It was time to assemble all the evidence since gathered and to make the final determination as to who to keep in containment and who to let go of.",

# Total Apathy

The following is a recording unearthed from the archives at the Stasi Records Agency in February of 2021. This was one of the last audiographs to be recovered before the agency was absorbed into the German Federal Archives.

The recording in question is a reel-to-reel tape, without a corresponding entry in the Index of Investigative References. The markings on it suggest three hypotheses:

One, the recording was part of a regular surveillance operation on the activities of Division IX, Investigative Body, of the Ministry of State Security, widely know as the Stasi.

Two, what division or organization ordered this surveillance operation was not marked nor recorded. Further investigation could reveal what body of work does this recording belong to. However, it is unlikely.

Three, the marking on the tin lid of this recording reads: Op.Panopticon E-0 Mk.II

[TRANSCRIPT START]

Subject 1: Today is March... March-er... what day, Mister Hobbes?

Subject 2: March... no it's not March anymore. We're in April, now. First of the month.

S.1: First day. April. Eighty-Eight.

S.2: What for?

S.1: I'm writing a memo to the boys in the box to increase their rate of first time approvals at least 5%. I'm getting tired of having to explain myself to Mielke's genital remorae.

S.2: That's not something I wanted to picture in my mind, thank you Mister Bentham. And don't forget, get rid of the prisoners in 17J and 17N.

S.1: It is my endless pleasure Mr. Hobbes. And thank you, I was forgetting that. I guess I had yesterday's Neues lying on my desk. For a moment I thought we were doubling down on our celebration of our victory of the criminal element.

S.2: Honestly, Mister Bentham, if Miss Lamarr did not bring you your three meals a day I think you'd starve to death.

S.1: I resent that Mister Hobbes, but then again... I don't think you're wrong.

S.2: Would not be the first time my dear friend. It won't be the only thing you're forgetting today. Today, we celebrate!

S.1: Ah yes. A Toast to the success of Division IX, and its efforts to protect and keep the safety of this wonderful Titanic! To Operation Panopticon!

S.2: Aaaah, Mister Bentham. I'm afraid that I will have to report you for speaking anti-citizen ideas. I think you should expect a nice warm squad of people ready to fill every nook and cranny of your soft, shitty body with summons to appear in--

S.1: Who are they going to tell? Division IX? The Politburo? Let them hear it, whoever them is... They know the end is coming, and you can't pull the wool over the eyes of everyone. You can try, sure, but it's not working anymore.

S.2: You mean you believe the rumors about Gorbachev?

S.1: Not only do I believe them. I have good word from Moscow that it's going to happen. He's going to let them own factories now.

S.2: No. They would never.

S.1: Four, maybe three years ago I would have scoffed at the idea as well. But the last few years have had a knack to prove me wrong every time.

S.2: Well. That's a bridge we'll cross when we get to it. But let us talk about today.

S.1: Yes, Operation Panopticon.

S.2: Let us recap.

S.1: One Lieutenant Oskar Sessler. Ministry Agent for 20 years. Rising star in the ranks. Has enough seniority to be three ranks above his station. However, he was kicked out of the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance for reasons unknown to us. He winds up an Operations Leader at Division VIII. Never moves up, down, or sideways. Keeps doing the same thing day in and day out, a perfectly average arrest and conviction ratio.

S.2: Right, so that's why we were suspicious. His salary did not explain the opulence he and his wife lived in.

S.1: In comes another particularly character, Sergeant Bertholt Bayer. Parents try to cross the border into the Federal Republic, they get neutralized, and the little Bert gets left behind. He's put under Wolf's supervision in Operation Piaget. Comes out best in class a soldier for us through and true. Rises through the ranks quickly, a Sergeant of Division VIII.

[PAUSE]

S.2: Remind me why we are looking into this guy, Mister Bantham.

S.1: Remember the big story about how an agent fell down the river and drowned?

S.2: No I don't.

S.1: Do you ever attend briefings Mister Hobbes? We made that up! The boys at Division XIX spent weeks creating that story. We had a smuggler already ready to sing when this living breathing piece of metal just started wailing on the guy. It was very hard to explain the bruises left in the bod of a drowned person. Oh and another thing. They hate each other.

S.2: Right, ok. So we put them together and then we engaged them in the same investigation. For which we created Nadine Leitzka.

S.1: We didn't create her, Mister Hobbes. So great is this nation of ours that the dead walk among us.

S.2: Right, because Letizka--

S.1: She never was the woman Hassel thought she was.

S.2: We need to give her a raise, that Nadine. She did a mighty fine job. She stuck to the script and everything.

S.1: I almost feel bad for the other guy, whats-his-face. He has no clue what's going on.

S.2: Nor he ever will.

S.1: You're not getting rid of him are you?

S.2: Nah, nah, nah. Let him think he dodged a bullet.

5.1 Nadine shows up in people's lives: First as Sessler's hopeful to jump over the fence, and next to Hassel as a long lost one-that-got-awayeds.

5.2 So, given all the pieces in place. What's the question we wanted to answer?

5.1: If you want it in a nutshell it's a test of loyalty. We trust ourselves with tremendous power, and while there is no doubt.

S.2: None?

S.1: None, that we are doing the right thing. But the power we have is terrifying, if you think about it for more than ten seconds.

S.2: Ok, I thought about it.

S.1: No, really think about it. We can do anything. Anything! To any one person. So how low?

S.2: How low, what?

S.1: How low can we go, Mister Hobbes? How low would they go to get over each other.

S.2: So... did we learn anything?

S.1: Not a damn thing!

S.2: Say it again!

S.1: NOT A DAMN THING!

S.2: Why is that, Mister Hobbes?

S.1: Because the agent that Sessler assigned to surveil decided to deliver nothing! Nada! Zilch! A garden slime would have been a better agent to surveil the greatest actress to ever live in the German Democratic Republic.

S.2: Gadzooks, Mister Hobbes! So, what do we do now!

S.1: We're doing the same thing as Operation Panopticon Mark I. We're telling them that our agents have zeal for rules and regulations only rivaled by our Soviet friends.

S.2: That's wonderful Mister Hobbes. D'you think they'll buy it?

S.1: Not even for a second, Mister Bantham.

S.2: Are they going to complain?

S.1: I don't think they well. You spend so much time with all this patriotic pantomime, and it all crashes down the more you know. And they know almost anything important there is to know. It's got to be either the funniest thing in the world or the worst job in the world.

S.2: They'd sooner have us break their arms than to tell the truth for ten seconds.

S.1: They're afraid, Hobbes.

S.2: Of what?

S.1: Excuse me?

S.2: Yeah... of what? They're the Politburo, there's no way to go but down.

S.1: You just said it Bantnam. They all have eyes looking into them. Eyes spying on them in their chambers, eyes that know what is the color of the stool they just dropped, eyes that document every single indiscretion, fling and rendez-vous. As long as they look good, nothing else matters.

S.2: Who is watching them though? Wolf?

S.1: Well yeah... and no. Wolf has his own little birds and spiders for sure. And those eyes are on our politburo friends. But he's not the only one doing some of the ol' phone tapping. But at the very least we know he is.

S.2: And Wolf is doing this because he's...

S.1: Afraid? You bet. He's got eyes on him too. Some are from the Politburo, some are from his own people, some are from the enemies. He knows he's being watched. But you hever know is watching though. That's the sick twisted thing of it. You know it. You know they're looking at you.

S.2: But you don't know who or when.

S.1: Precisely.

S.2: What about us Mister Bantnam.

S.1: That's a rather rookie question to make right?

S.2: Hah, yeah sorry.

S.1: Shame about the agent Eight-Red-Zero... whatever. Took a bullet to the head like a champ.

S.2: It was bound to happen sooner or later.

[A phone rings, any further conversation has been drown out by the sound of the ringing phone]

S.1: Yes? Yes this is him. Oh-ooo-oh. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Call it off. Call it off now! I don't care if it's too late, call it of now!

S.2: What's wrong Hobbes?

S.1: He's coming.

S.2: N-no-no. No way. No way. Is he coming personally or-?

S.1: I wouldn't bet on it. I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of his puppies. He knows.

[a brief silence]

S.2: We better leave, Bantnam. You never know who's watching.

S.1: C'mon, I've got the key to the silent door.

[TRANSCRIPT END]

There is no record, original, catalogued, or reassembled, of Operation Panopticon Marks I or II. There is also no current evidence of such Agents named either Bantnam or Hobbes working for Division IX in 1988. It is presumed that these were aliases or codenames.

The Transcript seems to accurately reflect current knowledge of Stasi prisoners: The Nadine Leitzka was an assumed identity, the true woman responding to that name most likely dead or missing. Albert Hassel was liberated following an a additional month from the time this tape was played. Current whereabouts unknown.

It is unknown if Lieutenant Oskar Sessler or Sergeant Bertholt Bayer are live or where are they now. Stasi documentation after July of 1988 was catalogued poorly, or destroyed following Reunification.

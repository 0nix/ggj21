# Total Apathy

The following is a recording unearthed from the archives at the Stasi Records Agency in February of 2021. This was one of the last audio records to be transcribed before the agency was absorbed into the Federal Archives.

The recording in question is a reel-to-reel tape, without a corresponding entry in the References Index. It's omission suggests that it was made after 1987, as the archive quality of the Intelligence Long Term Storage Facility started to decline around that time. We can theorize that they, like many in the service, knew that their best days were behind them. The markings on the container suggest three hypotheses:

One, the recording was part of a regular surveillance operation on the activities of Division IX, Investigative Body, of the Ministry of State Security, colloquially known as the Stasi.

Two, the division that ordered this surveillance operation was not marked nor recorded. Further investigation could reveal what body of work does this recording belong to. However, a conclusive outcome is unlikely.

Three, the marking on the tin lid of this recording reads: Op.Panopticon E-0 Mk.II

[TRANSCRIPT START]

Subject 1: Today is March... March-er... what day, Mister Hobbes?

Subject 2: March... no it's not March anymore. We're in April, now. First of the month.

S.1: First day. April. Eighty-Eight.

S.2: What for?

S.1: I'm writing a memo to the boys in the box to increase their rate of first time approvals at least five percent. I'm getting tired of having to explain myself to Mielke's genital remorae.

S.2: That's not something I wanted to picture in my mind.  Thank you, Mister Bentham. We mustn't forget to get rid of the prisoners in 17J and 17N.

S.1: It is my endless pleasure to give you wonderful images to think of at night, Mister Hobbes. And I was forgetting about those two. I guess I had yesterday's Neues lying on my desk. For a moment I thought I had hallucinated the celebration of our victory over the criminal element.

S.2: Honestly, Mister Bentham, if Miss Lamarr did not bring you your three meals a day I think you'd starve to death.

S.1: I resent that Mister Hobbes, but then again... I don't think you're wrong.

S.2: Would not be the first time, dear friend. It won't be the only thing you're forgetting today. Today, we celebrate!

S.1: Ah yes. A Toast to the success of Division IX, and its efforts to protect and keep the safety of this wonderful Titanic! To Operation Panopticon!

S.2: A-a-aah, Mister Bentham. I'm afraid that I will have to report you for speaking anti-citizen ideas. I think you should expect a nice warm squad of people ready to fill every nook and cranny of your soft, shitty body with summons to appear in--

S.1: Who are they going to tell? Division IX? The Politburo? Let them hear it, whoever them is... They know the end is coming. You can't pull the wool over everyone's eyes. You can try, sure, but it's not working anymore. I don't think it ever did.

S.2: You mean you believe the rumors about Gorbachev?

S.1: Not only do I believe them. I have good word from Moscow that it's going to happen. He's going to let them own factories now.

S.2: No. They would never.

S.1: Four, maybe three years ago I would have scoffed at the idea as well. But the last few years have had a knack to prove me wrong every time.

S.2: Well. That's a bridge we'll cross when we get to it. But let us talk about today.

S.1: Yes, Panopticon.

S.2: Give us the story.

S.1: Picture one Lieutenant Oskar Sessler. Ministry Agent for 20 years. Rising star in the ranks. Has enough seniority to be three ranks above his station. However, he was kicked out of the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance for reasons unknown to us. He winds up as an Operations Leader at Division VIII. Never moves up, down, or sideways. Keeps doing the same thing day in and day out, a perfectly average arrest and conviction ratio. And yet he enjoys luxuries that men of his station do not get to enjoy.

S.2: Right, so that's why we were suspicious. His salary does not explain the opulence he and his wife live in.

S.1: Enter stage right, Sergeant Bertholt Bayer. Parents try to cross the border into the Federal Republic, they get neutralized, and little Bert gets left behind. He's put under Wolf's supervision in Operation Piaget. Comes out best in class a soldier for us through and true. A true believer. An idiot so useful it would make Comrade Lenin dry heave. Rises through the ranks quickly, becomes a Sergeant of Division VIII.

[A Pause in the conversation. The sound of ice cubes clinking on a glass can be heard.]

S.2: Remind me why we are looking into this guy, Mister Bantham.

S.1: Remember the big story about how an agent of Division VII fell down the river and drowned?

S.2: No I don't.

S.1: Do you ever attend briefings Mister Hobbes? We made that up! The boys at Division XIX spent weeks creating that story. We had a smuggler already ready to confess when the concrete slab who got its wish to be human just started wailing on the guy. It was very hard to explain the bruises left in the corpse of a drowned person, I'll tell you that much. Oh and another thing.

S.2: What's that?

S.1: They hate each other.

S.2: Right, ok. So we put them together and then we engaged them in the same investigation. For this very purpose, we created Nadine Leitzka.

S.1: We didn't create her, Mister Hobbes. So great is this nation of ours that the dead walk among us.

S.2: Right, because Letizka--

S.1: She's not the same woman Albert Hassel met.

S.2: We need to give her a raise, that Nadine. She did a mighty fine job. She stuck to the script and everything.

S.1: I almost feel bad for the other guy, whats-his-face. He has no clue what's going on.

S.2: Nor he ever will.

S.1: You're not getting rid of him are you?

S.2: Nah, nah, nah. Let him think he dodged a bullet.

5.1 Nadine shows up in people's lives: First as one of Sessler's clients for extended stays out of our borders, and next to Hassel as a long lost one-that-got-awayeds.

5.2 So, given all the pieces in place. What's the question we wanted to answer?

5.1: If you want it in a nutshell, it's a test of our system. We are endowed with tremendous responsibility and power, and while there is no doubt--

S.2: None?

S.1: None, that we are doing the right thing. The reality is that the power we have is quite terrifying, if you think about it for more than ten seconds.

S.2: Oh, I think about it. 

S.1: No, really think about it. We can do anything. Anything! To any one person. So what is the limit?

S.2: Of what?

S.1: How far can one man go, Mister Hobbes? How low would they go to get over each other.

S.2: So... did we learn anything?

S.1: Not a damn thing!

S.2: Say it again!

S.1: NOT A DAMN THING!

S.2: Why is that, Mister Hobbes?

S.1: Because the agent that Sessler assigned to surveil decided to deliver nothing! Nada! Zilch! A garden slime would have been a better agent to watch the greatest actress to ever live in the German Democratic Republic.

S.2: Heavens, Mister Hobbes! So, what do we do now!

S.1: We're doing the same thing as Operation Panopticon Mark I. We're telling them that our agents have zeal for rules and regulations only rivaled by our Soviet friends.

S.2: That's wonderful Mister Hobbes. D'you think they'll buy it?

S.1: Not even for a second, Mister Bantham.

S.2: Are they going to complain?

S.1: I don't think they well. So much time wasted with all this patriotic pantomime, and it all falls apart the more you're in the know. And they know almost anything important there is to know. It's got to be either the funniest thing in the world or the worst job ever.

S.2: They'd sooner have get their arms broken in half than to tell the truth for ten seconds.

S.1: They're afraid, Hobbes.

S.2: Of what?

S.1: Excuse me?

S.2: Yeah... of what? They're the Politburo, there's nobody they're accountable to.

S.1: And that is where you are dead wrong, Mister Bantham. They all have eyes looking into them. Eyes spying on them in their chambers, eyes that know what is the color of the stool they just dropped, eyes that document every single indiscretion, fling and rendez-vous. As long as they look good, nothing else matters.

S.2: Who is watching them though? Wolf?

S.1: Well yes... and no. Wolf has his own little birds and spiders for sure. And those eyes are on our politburo friends. But he's not the only one doing some of the ol' phone tapping. But at the very least we know he is.

S.2: And Wolf is doing this because he's...

S.1: Afraid? You bet. They're all afraid. They spy each other. Every Politburo member that has more than ten brain cells to rub together has their own Stasi, looking for ways to plunge a knife on each other's backs.

[A brief pause]

S.1: That's why Wolf's got eyes on them. He's got people everywhere. Some are from the Politburo, some are from his own people, some are from our enemies beyond Brandenburg Gate. He knows he's being watched. But you never know who's watching though. That's the sick twisted thing of it. You know it. You know they're looking at you.

S.2: But you don't know exactly who or when.

S.1: Precisely.

S.2: What about us Mister Bantnam.

S.1: That's a rather rookie question to make right?

S.2: Hah, yeah. Sorry.

S.1: Shame about the agent Eight-Red-Zero... whatever. Took a bullet to the head like a champ.

S.2: It was bound to happen sooner or later.

[A phone rings, any further conversation has been drown out by the sound of the ringing phone]

S.1: Yes? Yes this is him. Oh-ooo-oh. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Call it off. Call it off now! I don't care if it's too late, call it of now!

S.2: What's wrong Hobbes?

S.1: He's coming.

S.2: N-no-no. No way. No way. Is he coming personally or-?

S.1: I wouldn't bet on it. I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of his dogs. He knows.

[a brief silence]

S.2: We better leave, Bantham. You never know who's watching.

S.1: C'mon, I know a way out.

[TRANSCRIPT END]

There is no record, original, catalogued, or reassembled, of Operation Panopticon Marks I or II. There is also no current evidence of such Agents named either Bantham or Hobbes working for Division IX in 1988. It is presumed that these were aliases or codenames.

The Transcript seems to accurately reflect current knowledge of Stasi prisoners: The name "Nadine Leitzka" was an assumed identity of a women presumed dead, the true identity of the woman who called herself "Nadine" is most likely dead or missing. Albert Hassel was liberated following an a additional month from the time this tape was played. Current whereabouts unknown.

It is unknown if Lieutenant Oskar Sessler or Sergeant Bertholt Bayer are alive nor where are they now. As stated before, Stasi documentation declined in quality starting in 1987. After July of 1988, most records were partially or completely destroyed following Reunification.

## Apathy Ending

Sergeant Bayer closes the dossier shut and gets up without saying a word. So does Lieutenant Sessler. So do you. The door of the interrogation room comes opens and closes, with a whine and clang that rumbles in your ear drums. Both men walk double-time down the corridor, making a beeline for another part of Central. You know where they're headed, so you can follow them without paying too much attention.

It's over. Finally it's over. 

Your job cannot be called "fun" by any stretch of the imagination. But this has been a particularly unpleasant drag. Usually your immediate superior never had any intentions to do anything other the minimum required to maintain their position, and in time you had learned to be just as perfunctory. It was a real fight to remain that way.

As you walk by the canteen you start thinking late lunch, early dinner. What would be good? You had been on nothing but the bare minimum for sustenance. While a standard for surveillance jobs, you couldn't stop yourself from thinking from a full-course meal. The smell of food lingers just a bit as you come to your destination: Division IX, or the Procedural Investigative Body. No faces. No people. Just a cold, hard, rusted steel wall with a slot to exchange documents, a microphone and a speaker.

Division IX is a review board for standard and special investigative operations across State Security. The Ministry will not act unless a conviction is all but guaranteed, after all punishments in this country were designed to deter  and destroy the anti-citizen element. 

To make sure our record stays clean, and to prevent the Comrades working for Division IX to suffer from retaliation, nobody was allowed to know their identity or their rank. The agents would be given decoy designations and positions, with their post in Division IX only disclosed to Division Heads, the Office of the Minister, and their closest allies in Division II Counter-Intelligence. This much secrecy at such a scale can only be maintained if Division IX had unclassified liaisons that spoke for it, like Bayer. 

You often found that the word "special" in "special operation" was a largely meaningless term. There would be little distinction between what was considered a normal operation and a special one. No matter what, it would always involve some poor bastard behind a desk with a tape recorder, sometimes a live camera feed, snooping in someone else. The only thing odd about this whole circus you were roped into was the fast turnaround. If not for the constant bickering between your superiors, you wouldn't mind to go through more jobs like this one.

As secretive as they are, Division IX personnel can't help but be bound to the limits of the human flesh and mind. The unspoken rule among the agents of the Ministry was that you should give your reviewer the least amount of work possible. They'd always be thankful for something they could just rubber-stamp and hand over.

"Excuse me, Comrade. I must have misheard you the first time." Sergeant Bayer says, his voice a bit shaky. "Could you repeat that again?" 

You look up to see Bayer and Sessler. It doesn't take a genius at reading body language that they are not pleased.

"I will repeat." The voice from the speaker says in the same monotone cadence that greeted you every day after wrapping up surveillance.

"It is the determination of this Division's Preliminary Review that there is no conclusive evidentiary through-line to arraign nor convict any of the two people currently being detained in this operation. The items presented in this investigative dossier, as well as the reasons for their inclusion, are contradictory and do not construct the minimum for assigning culpability."

Oh no.

"We have argued these evidentiary points, Comrade. There is no doubt that Subject of Interest A.H. needs to remain under detention!" Lieutenant Sessler says, still gesticulating in the air as if he could convince a microphone.

"Comrade, I would like to invoke special privileges to continue to detain Subject of Interest N.L. Standard Procedures Rule Number-" Sergeant Bayer said, moving towards the microphone mounter on the wall and directly in front of Sessler.

"The decision of this Division is final. The Subjects of Interest will be released after the standard waiting period has expired. If the Commanding Officers wish to continue the investigation, it must be on appeal. No more evidence will be accepted."

"Comrade! Did you actually read the dossier?! The lives of--" Lieutenant Sessler starts to yell, before he is interrupted by the speaker on the wall once again.

"Furthermore, it is the determination of this Division that Agent Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-Three, pending further review, will be the subject of Disciplinary Action effective immediately."

Oh no.

Suddenly, you feel an incoming numbness around your nose and your fingertips. Your superiors turn around to face you. If they could, their ears would spit out smoke and fire.

"On Preliminary Review, it is the opinion of this Division that Agent Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-Three has grossly declined to perform their duties. Culpability must be assigned and Sabotage ruled out before the Agent is permitted to resume their duties. All privileges and rights given to Agent Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-Three will be revoked until further notice. Immediate detainment is advisable, followed by-"

You didn't even have the chance to finish hearing the message before Sergeant Bayer bull-rushed you and pinned you to the ground. You hit the floor and you feel his entire weight on your chest and arms. On reflex you start to squirm just to get some room to breathe but he crushes you, relentlessly. "You will submit, Detainee!" He roars. "I will not tolerate would-be saboteurs! Not on my sight!" 

You turn your head. You can't avoid resting your tongue on the floor where you were standing ten seconds ago. You taste the soles of every dick who had ever worked at the Stasi. You crane your neck up, but Sessler pushes you back down. "Down, you dog! Down, I say!" He yells with an increasingly crazed tone of voice. The sounds of boots on the ground echo all around you. 

They belong to the people that were actually supposed to detain you, without a doubt. 

Perhaps calling your performance "gross" was beyond the pale. The one day they decided to give a damn was today. And it just had to be your investigation they reviewed.

The boots on the ground get closer and closer still, and pretty soon you feel the Sergeant's weight lifted from your body only to be manhandled by pairs of unknown hands pinning your arms behind your back in handcuffs.

"Stand up! You are hereby detained by the Ministry of State Security on counts of Dereliction of Duty and Attempt to Sabotage State Operations!" You hear some guy in a helmet shout at you as they stand you up. They twist you around to face another hallway. 

Right in front of you, a poltergeist in uniform. No, it's Lieutenant Sessler, only a few centimeters away from your face. He shakes his head, but he also smiles that yellow devil smile of his. "Time to make chicken salad out of chicken shit, Brownie. It seems that's all you were good for." He says. The smell of his breath makes you wince.

"Take him away to Guard Tower J, boys. Let's make it a nice one, huh?" He orders as he gets out of the way. You count about six men pushing and pulling you as you are marched away from Lieutenant Sessler and Sergeant Bayer.

That last whiff from canteen would probably be the last time you smell good food. Because there's no going back from a Stasi Agent that has just been accused of sabotage.

They might as well have called you a traitor, or a rebel, or a dissident. Right now, you'd do anything to get transferred to the mail room.

At least they didn't call you western spy, you'd be shot on the spot.

As you walk by hallways and rooms you had never had a need to visit regularly, the weight of those words sunk in your stomach like a brick. Disciplinary Review. 

A bullet to the head or a noose would preferable, because at least you know what's going to happen. You are not going to survive this, that is a fact. But they'll toy with you first, and that's the part you don't know. You don't know what is Guard Tower J.

Everything is a blur until it isn't. In front of you there is a heavy metal door. A loud swing and a clang later, and behind it a room with a cot and a bucket. They uncuff you, and five seconds later they throw you into the cell.

You don't have time to use your hands to break the fall, you  go inside head first and you crash into the cold concrete. 

Everything smells of week-old piss.

You can't even turn around to see the faces of your jailers before they slam the door shut and you hear all the locks and levers click into place.

There isn't even a letterbox window like for the people you have just detained. No natural or artificial light to help you find your way around the cell.

Complete and total darkness, not even under the door. This was a cell in Guard Tower J.

...

Day 1.

A loud clang at your door wakes you up. You see a rectangular slide engage and open up on the bottom of your door. 

Food? Food!

You run towards the floor. You have the opportunity to ask one question before the guard steps away.

["When am I going to be on trial?"]

["Am I going to die?"]

(For both) Wordlessly, whoever is doing the rounds slides a plate of soup and mush, then slides the slit shut again.

Your eyes have to get used to the darkness again, so for a while you can't even tell where the food is. 

Once you do, you can see in the darkness that there's no utensils. Just a bowl and a plate on a tray. They expect you to use your hands.

So you eat with just your hands.

...

Day 2.

You don't know how many hours it has been since the last meal. But you know it must have been more than six. Maybe seven? It's hard to tell, you can't really know how much time has passed. The same clang alerts you to the presence of food.

You hurry to try to speak to whoever is on the other side, maybe they'll talk to you this time.

["Can I get something else to eat?"]

["When will be asked for an interrogation?"]

Then, just as before, they slide the plate of soup and mush and close the lid shut without a word.

The light is blinding. It takes you more time to get used to the darkness again. Only then can you see your sustenance and reach out for it for fear of spilling whatever meager food stuffs you could get.

Try again tomorrow?

[Yes]

...

Day 3? You're quite confident they're serving you one meal a day, so it's fair to say Day 3. 

You hear the same familiar clang, and you suppose its the same deal with the food. As soon as you hear it you're on high alert and you stick your hand before the tray can be slid into your cell. 

What will you say?

[I need help!]

[Kill me already!]

As soon as you get your hand out there, you hear some yelling you can't quite make out, and then you feel this pain.

This terrible pain. They're stomping on your hand. They're not stopping. You feel the weight of an entire human body press on your muscles and bones again and again.

You can't avoid pulling it back. 

It really hurts.

They slide the food tray and close the lid shut.

They are not going to answer.

[No]

...

Day 3? Yes, Day 3. Or could it be 5? It's fair to say that it is Day 4. You hear the slide door open and the tray clanging against the floor of your cell. You just open one eye ever so slightly, so that the light doesn't blind you completely. 

You had already resolved to not waste your time trying to get anything out of the guards. They are not going to say anything. If you were in their position you wouldn't either.

...

Day 6, you think. 

You've tried to keep a tally for every time there's a food tray slid down your door, scratching the surface of your cell wall for markings. But soon you realized that you had a problem telling your marks apart from the other bumps and markings on the walls. 

You're not even sure they're feeding you once day.

...

Day 11? 

It all kinda blurs together. It's only when you sleep when you remember people, colors, shapes, the outside. That beautiful world beyond the door. 

Wait, beautiful? 

Is that really what you called it back then?

That doesn't sound right.

One more marking on the wall. But it's pointless to still continue to count.

...

Day Twenty-something.

You see that dream again. That one where there is a light so blinding and so hot it cooks you alive. You woke up screaming again.

The liquid feeling around your loins tells you that you wet the bed... again. Not that you could do anything about it. It had already happened to you five meals ago. Or was it seven?

The smell of your own urine is pungent. More than usual.

...

Day Thirty, or Fourty-something.

You're not sure anymore. You feel like your limbs are completely disjointed for your body. You don't even feel like eating anymore. You see the tray with the same paste and the same soup. 

You wish for a glass of water. Really cold water. 

Like, ice cold. 

Like the floor. Like the cell.

Something to get you off this feeling of being parched but not dehydrated, hungry but not famished.

...

Day Fifty-seventeen.

It's the damp interior of a room with overly varnished wood panelling. In front of you is a judge, sitting high on his lectern, and everywhere you look there's a square window and a single unblinking eye looking at you from every angle. The eyes dart and zip, looking at everything and nothing at the same time.

You look down and you can't find the rest of your torso, your legs, or your feet. You're a half man. You're not even sure you have arms and legs anymore.

"Will Lieutenant Oskar Sessler please give his final remarks?" Says the judge, unhinging it's jaw with what you can only assume is an arm protruding from the front of his torso. You'd think he couldn't move his limbs, on account of him having his entire body impaled with large steel rebar wires.

The courtroom walls warp and wobble, and the eyes continue to watch you from every angle. You look away, then you look again and it's Lieutenant Sessler.

That's new, but not surprising. He's on fire.

He's on fire and he's completely unfazed. His skin just seems to be red all over, and the top of his chrome dome seems to have exploded and now all sorts of bony gnarls and horns protrude from it. He opens his mouth and a sickly green mist oozes out of it. His voice is halfway between a coughing smoker and a cat in agony. 

"Our investigation found that Agent Brownie was not only neglecting his duties during surveillance operations for our Ministry, we found in his apartment heinous things that would make any regular citizen sick. We found half-eaten corpses of rats and raccoons, as well as canvas paintings made with what we can only assume to be bodily fluids: Feces, blood, and urine have been confirmed. We have some suspicion that these feculent pieces of art cannot consist entirely out of his own body given the size and the scope of some of them. We might be looking at a serial murderer working under our very own noses."

As he spoke, his entire body warped and twisted, you could see the fire leaking out of orifices that would open and close all around his body, undulating and moving around like waves against a pier.

"Thank you Lieutenant, that will be all." The judge says.

The Lieutenant melts into his own body and becomes a fleshy burning goop that secretes all manner of foul odors. It leaks through the gaps in the square window, where the eyes have not stopped moving quickly. It's like they're sleeping with their eyes wide open.

"Will the Sergeant Bertholt Bayer please give his final remarks?" The judge calls. There is a change of color in his body. Or is it her? The judge is golden now, and you can see the curves and ridges of a woman. At least you think it is.

From the ether, the Sergeant materializes. At least you think it's Bayer. All you see is a suit of armor, must be twice as tall as you. The voice from this armor is appropriately strained and metallic. As he spoke, the plates of armor rattled and scraped against each other.

"Agent Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-Three has demonstrated, through his surveillance work and the positions that he adopted during our interrogatory reviews between myself and Lieutenant Oskar Sessler that he is a subversive element that must be expunged from this Ministry and this country. Every breath that he draws is air that he robs from the true and honest citizens of this country! He must not be allowed to continue to rob us any further! We must expunge depraved bloodsuckers like him! He is not human!"

As the suit of armor continues to shout, his words become more unhinged and unintelligible. It moves more and more violently and as it does, from the dark crevices of the plates come maggots and bugs spraying everywhere. Some of them landing and crawling on your face.

"Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!" Bayer vociferates. 

Then, the armor's helmet falls off in all the violent thrashing. More and more rattling fills your ears.

"KILL HIM! KILL HIM! KILL HIM!"

The voice becomes a multiplicity of the same voice protesting at different times as fire begins to shine through the hole where the head inside the suit of armor should be. It emerges through every cavity, raging and exploding as if it was alive. You turn to see the judge fully transformed into Lady Justice herself: Golden, blind, and holding the scales on one hand and a sword in the other.

"KILL HIM KILL HIM KILL HIM"

It's no longer shouting, whatever this thing Bayer is. It's droning on and on and on like the tick-tock of a clock. The walls of eyes all around dart more quickly, more violently. Lady Justice's body bubbles and bloats, the familiar symbol twisting itself into a mangled fractal of golden nightmares.

Out from the suit armor protrudes a fiery, gnarly skull moving its jaw bone up and down. You know, somehow, that it is Oskar Sessler. His raspy voice joins the metallic din of Bayer's. "KILLIM KILLIM KILLIM" They both holler in a terrible harmonization.

Just when you think the noise will make your head explode, and you want to scream. You want to scream as loud as you can but you can't find a mouth to do it. 

This terrible noise. You can't can even hear yourself.

You can't think. 

You feel it. It enters you and sets fire to your senses, like a million tiny explosions.

And it stops.

You turn your head the ungodly monster that accused you of so many terrible things is gone. The judge is now gone too. All that remains is this sphere of eyes. 

They're not darting around anymore. They're looking at you.

Every single one of them fixated upon you.

Even the ones that you cannot crane your head to see. You feel them looking at you.

And they burn like the sun through a magnifying glass.

You can't move, you can't do anything. They look at you and they stare and they do not move. They see you in your everything. 

You look around anywhere, somewhere there has to be you can rest your eyesight and there isn't something that gives it right back to you.

If you could you'd plead for mercy.

Anything but these eyes that look at you.

There it is.

Yes, a long black thing. 

A shadow?

Yes, it's a shadow?

Your shadow?

Whatever it is, it's getting bigger. It was a pinprick, then it was a thin line, and now its as wide as you are. Well, what you think is you. 

The shadow thing gets bigger.

It's shaped like a person, a real human person.

["Hey!"]

["Hello!"]

You holler at it. It does not respond.

["Who are you?"]

["Why won't you answer me?"]

It grows bigger, blotting out the gaze of these eyes.

["Are you looking at me?"]

["Will you help me?"]

It does not respond still, and the shadow grows to overtake everything you can see. There is nothing but pure blackness. The eyes are no more.

But you can still feel it.

A set of eyes.

["Look away!"]

You can't see them, but they see you.

["Look away!"]

They are staring at you.

["Look away!"]

Unflinching.

["Stop looking at me!"]

Es gibt kein Entrinnen vor den Augen an den Wänden. (run a script to play a gunshot and stop printing the sentence)

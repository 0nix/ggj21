# Centrist

Sergeant Bayer closes the dossier shut and gets up without saying a word. So does Lieutenant Sessler. So do you. The door of the interrogation room comes open and closes, with a rattle and hum that feels like the largest book your imagination could conjure has been closed shut. The men walk down the corridor, making their way to another dark corner of Central.

You know where they're going, you'll catch up.

You stand there, and you look up at a small rectangular slit on the wall. Its the thinnest of windows letting in the sunlight. A cloud ever so shyly blocks the star, and splashes on these dreary corridors a play of shadows and lights. Some gray, some white, some darker.

Perhaps it's time to go to Friederischfeilde again, but not for the job. A nice snack on a park bench. Perhaps a soda too. Yes, that would be nice.

"Agent, you are required to accompany us to Division IX." The booming voice of Sergeant Bayer snaps you out of this unsanctioned contemplation.

As you walk by the canteen you start thinking late lunch, early dinner. What would be good? You had been on nothing but the bare minimum for sustenance. While a standard for surveillance jobs, you couldn't stop yourself from thinking from a full-course meal. The smell of a full plate of food lingers in your mind just a bit as you come to your destination: Division IX, or the Procedural Investigative Body. No faces. No people. Just a cold, hard, rusted steel wall with a slot to exchange documents, a microphone and a speaker.

Division IX is a review board for standard and special investigative operations across State Security. The Ministry will not act unless a conviction is all but guaranteed. After all, punishments in this country were designed to strike fear into criminal minds and deter good citizens from straying from their obligations to their fellow comrades.

To make sure our record stays clean, and to prevent the Comrades working for Division IX to fall victim from retaliation, nobody was allowed to know their identity or their rank. The agents would be given decoy designations and positions, with their post in Division IX only disclosed to Division Heads, the Office of the Minister, and their closest allies in Division II Counter-Intelligence. This much secrecy at such a scale can only be maintained if Division IX had unclassified liaisons that spoke for it, like Bayer.

They'll endow with the ability to essentially point the finger at anyone and put them in a cell for at least a day, so long as they completely humiliate you first, and they will still treat you like a schoolchild. Sometimes you'd sneak in a little something, just for kicks. A word like "watermelon" or "sassafras" into the write-ups. Just to see if they were actually read your work. They've either never noticed, or never cared enough to mention it.

Of course, you'd never know. The members of Division IX all have aliases, fake positions within other departments, and divulging that information is an executable offense without a trial. Not even their families are allowed to know their real occupations. For all function and purpose, they were spies in plain sight.

[Sessler Option]

"Comrade," Lieutenant Sessler said, with a particularly slow enunciation. "as Command Officer of Surveillance Operation XX7-HGW, I would like to advise the continued detainment of Subject of Interest A.H--"

"Must you insist in your crusade against the most boring man in Germany, Oskar?!" Sergeant Bayer protests before he addresses the microphone bolted into the iron wall. "Comrade, I invoke my privileges as a Liaison for Division IX, identifier Delta-Lima-Delta-Alpha-Eight-One-Ten. We must belay--"

"You will not get in my way anymore, maggot!" Oskar growls as he turns towards the Sergeant and grabs him by his lapels.

[Bayer Option]

"Agent, this is Liaison identifier Delta-Lima-Delta-Alpha-Eight-One-Ten." You hear Sergeant Bayer address the microphone on the wall. "I am hereby requesting the continued detainment of Subject of Interest N.L. pursuant to this investigation. I believe we have sufficient evidence to pursue charges of evasion from the law, as well as unlawful activities--"

"No we do not, Division IX. We do not want to request that." Lieutenant Sessler interrupts, elbowing the Sergeant away from the microphone. Sessler was not anticipating that, so he is swept aside with ease. "Belay that, Comrade. Belay." Sessler growls. "I need to have a word with this mook."

"This will be your last time, Sessler! You are under arrest for--" The Sergeant hollers, as he fumbles around his pockets for his hand cuffs.

[End Option]

"You will stand down, now." The disembodied voice from the speaker interrupts the two men as they readied themselves for, well, whatever it was they wanted to do to each other. Both Sessler and Bayer stiffen up and stand up straight at this order as they continue to glare at each other.

"Lieutenant Oskar Sessler. Sergeant Bertholt Bayer. You will be receiving official reprimands for the behavior we have just observed." The speaker on the wall said.

The word "official" had a bit of a sting to it, even if it sometimes smacked of meaninglessness.

"It is the determination of this Division's Preliminary Review that there is no conclusive evidentiary through-line to arraign nor convict any of the two people currently being detained in this operation. The items presented in this investigative dossier, as well as the reasons for their inclusion, do not provide a clear argument for further processing of Subjects of Interest N.L nor A.H. There is some evidence for either person for an accusation of treason to be credible, however it is not quantitatively significant enough for detention. Any further privation of rights of these citizens will cease, pending our standard detainment time."

[Sessler Option]

"Agent, there has to be some mistake! We have a real traitor on the loose!" Lieutenant Sessler pleads to the microphone.

[Bayer Option]

"Agent, as your liaison I must compel you to see that you are making a grave mistake! This woman must be stopped! She must!" Sergeant Bayer pleads to the microphone.

[End Option]

"The decision of this Division is final. If the Commanding Officers wish to continue the investigation, it must be on appeal. No more evidence will be accepted."

The words out of the speaker box were like running tap water over a scalding hot frying pan. Both men were too shocked to continue arguing with each other. But, the wall had spoken. They would have to continue their work on their own time and resources, and the end of your involvement.

What joy.

"Agent," Lieutenant Sessler mutters, with a rather palpable hatred mixed in with exasperation. "You are now dismissed. Resume your duties, go kick a puppy, I don't care. Ju-just get out of my sight."

You salute, and walk away. You'd see another assignment tomorrow, and the excursion to Friederichsfielde would come on the weekend.

...

It's evening and you're not staring at strangers through a camera the size of a gnat's ass. But you're still looking at a television anyway. Only this time, it's meant to be entertaining. The primetime variety show, with contestants, quizzes, and prizes.

Mercifully mindless entertainment.

The fridge had greeted you with most of your stock going stale, so you had to make do with a mainstay of your Soviet friends: Butterbrod. Which is to say, a piece of bread, a slice of doctor's sausage, and the chunk of cheese that had not grown mold yet. They say it's still not good for you even if you had not seen mold yet, but you had been lucky all the times you had taken that risk. Or, you were really eating mold and it just wasn't killing you.

[rrring]

Your door bell goes off. It's six in the afternoon. There is not a warm body working in the mail department that worked this late. That means it's them.

Through the peephole you see a group of four, maybe five people dressed in Ministry grey trenchcoats. It's got to be a big deal.

You respond to them with a coded knock on the door, you started to perform the handshake.

It was one hard knock.

One soft knock.

Another hard knock.

One soft knock.

They were supposed to respond with three hard knocks.

Where were they?

But you hear them ring the door again. Wait, what? What are they even doing?

You look right back into the peep hole.

There they are, they had not moved an inch.

You perform the start of the handshake again.

One hard knock, one soft knock.

One hard knock, one soft knock.

They're supposed to answer, why are they not answering?

You stick your eye into the peephole trying to see if there was any activity on the other side. No, they just looked like they were just expecting for you to open the door.

Once again they ring. You're not opening the door. Not at this hour. That's not going to happen, they should know better.

One more time, you're going to attempt it one more time and if they don't respond you're going to have to phone Central.

But then you see it.

You see your door knob rotating and moving up and down on it's own.

Up down, up down.

It's barely noticeable. The silence allows you to hear a pin setting, and the lock-picker moving into the next cylinder.

They're picking the lock.

And they're doing it so silently, you had not even noticed at the start.

This is not the work of an amateur thief.

The men outside in gray. The lockpicking. The refusal to answer the secret handshake.

Oh, it's so simple. They're coming from you.

You sprint away from the door towards the phone.

You have to phone Central.

Why though?

You know what they're going to do to you.

Maybe it's a mistake?

Even if it was it won't matter.

As you grab the earpiece, you can hear your front door swing open and smash into the wall, several footsteps hurriedly trotting in your direction.

If you can only dial the num-

The weight of four men pin you to the ground as if you were made out of tissue paper. They don't give you a chance to use your hands to save your face from hitting the hard floor.

Even when you've had it done to you multiple times, it still hurts.

"Now, now. Agent." A voice near your ear whispers. "This is going to be as painful as you want it to be. Your choice."

[Relax]

That's it, this is the end. You stay perfectly still, like a statue.

"Good Agent. Time to say good night." Says the voice.

You feel a burning prick on the side of your neck.

[end choice]

[Fight back]

No. This is a mistake. You wriggle and you try to resist the body mass of these people pinning you down. At least you've got to get a good look at the people currently trying to subdue you. You catch a few glimpses of the person who presumably just whispered in your ear.

You see them turned away from you, and he... she? reveals themselves with their interrogation mask on, concealing their identity. As if you needed more confirmation. This person proceeds to smash your head against the floor some more.

"Fine then. We'll have some fun before he gets to you." They stop pinning your head down, just to start kicking on your side.

And they know where to kick, immediately the pain comes on and the air gets knocked out of you.

Another kick and you feel it grazing your rib.

Another one, and you feel more and more pain that you're powerless to stop.

The masked assailant grabs you by your hair and stabs you with a syringe on the neck.

[end choice]

Your vision becomes extremely blurry as colors and the edges of objects swirl and blend together. Your assailants let you go and their faces are all the mushy and distorted. They become rather inhuman as everything around you goes dark.

This is the last time you'll see your house and your belongings. And you can't even do that right.

They all look at you, as everything goes dark.

...

H.

Help?

The first thing you notice are the black markings on the wall. From here you could see what they are. It's a message. Written with what you can't really tell. But it does say something. It says "HELP" in elongated, tortured strokes.

The rest of the world comes into focus and you're slowly waking up.

"Let him know the Agent's awake." You hear someone out of sight say. Then you hear a few steps walking away from you. Then you hear a metal door swing open and close with a rattle and hum.

Another stranger out of sight grabs and sits you up on a metal chair. The world is still swimming in gelatin, as the sudden change in perspective nearly makes you gag. That's when you notice something is stuck in your mouth -- you have been gagged.

With what little energy you have you look around the room trying to make out something. Anything. You crane your head and you look at the wall with the black marks. From below they spelled out "HELP", but sitting here they looked like random black smudges.

Across from you, a metal table, and beyond that a metal door that opens as another figure enters the room. It nods and the men who apprehended you file out. Your vision is still blurry and out of focus, and you still cannot make out who is who yet. The door closes again, and it leaves you and this figure, ostensibly, alone.

[Sessler Option]

"Hello, Agent Brownie."

There's only one person that calls you that. You'd recognize that voice pretty much anywhere. Even if it's muffled.

"Who would have know that all this time. All this time! You were working against this very organization. A mole. In my team. My division."

He takes a deep breath.

"YOU KNOW HOW THAT MAKES ME LOOK?! EH?!" He roars as he slams the metal table. The noise is like a wrecking crew in your eardrums.

"Well Brownie," He goes on, pulling himself back. "Too bad you just had to leave your literature on your desk. What a rube! He's been radicalized by United Left, the same pigeons planting bombs and making noise, and just like that he leaves their pamphlets on his desk."

He inhales deeply in his mask.

"We have to let them go you know? You had a job. All you had to do was to pin a dud bomb on that overgrown hamster of a man. But since you decided to stick up for your dear comrades, we had to let that bastard go. But hey! I caught a terrorist inside our very own organization! And all I had to do was to drop that rodent's papers on your desk, I would call that a win. An absolute win."

The world swirls and turns, and you wish you could barf.

"I hope it was worth it to cross me, Brownie. I hope this is everything you ever wanted. Because it's all you're getting."

You hear the door open once again.

"Come give him another one, drop him on Jail Tower C."

You hear more footsteps. More people coming in. They're blending into the walls.

"By the way," you hear him say. "Do you mind if I take your couch? You won't be needing it."

[Bayer Option]

"Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-One-Three. I've got your Ministry File here you know? Thinner than a breath mint."

That enunciation. It's him.

"Not a lot here besides your background check from your Academy days. After that, not much of note. I do wonder where did you get off joining a terrorist group. Tell me, are these yours?"

You hear a bunch of papers slam on the metal table. Your vision's still kinda blurry, but you can make it enough to see that they're not yours.

"Pamphlets, Agent? Of the same organization that attempted to bomb the houses of the Politburo? On your desk? Are we cocky or are we stupid? Do you think I am that much of a moron?"

You wish you could answer. Those are not yours.

"ANSWER ME DAMN YOU!"

He smashes his fists on the metal table. The noise. If you could weaponize it would stun, even kill. It's like a wrecking crew in your eardrums.

"Ah, you're gagged. I'd apologize if I wasn't so disgusted being inside this damn room with you."

He breathes deeply in his mask.

"This will be the only time I'll resort to Sessler's bag of tricks. But, you leave me no choice. You've broken the rules, Agent. Someone must fall, or we look weak. You did not provide me with what I asked of you. So, you'll fall on your sword. You'll have watered the tree of this country with your blood. Be happy that at least you'll do that."

The world swirls and turns, if you could you'd vomit.

He knocks on the door. "Agent, proceed to administer another dose of barbiturates and detain him on Jail Tower C." He says.

You hear more footsteps. More people coming in. They're blending into the walls.

"We must always prevail, Agent." you hear him say. "We are the Sword and Shield of the State, after all."

[End Option]

You feel another pin prick and the world becomes dark once more.

Help.

...

_WHAM_,_WHAM_,_WHAM._

...

_WHAM_,_WHAM_,_WHAM._

..

_WHAM_,_WHAM_,_WHAM._

You're awake again. Not that you had much of a choice in the first place. There's some muted thuds from the other side of the wall. A wall?

The world spins around you as you regain consciousness. You're no longer gagged, which is good. You're not tied up either, which is also good. You're still tremendously drugged. That's bad.

Speaking of which, there's something in your stomach that has to come out.

[Play a sound of vomiting]

...

Definitely not one of your brightest moments.

This place is a holding cell. A standard cell in Central for suspect detainment. Eggshell white covered in the markings and liquids of those that came before you. And you just added yours to the collection

There's a hard cot to sleep in, and a letterbox window with a pinprick point mesh to let the light in. It's still day time.

You've been in one of these cells before. Not the best situation to be in, but it could be worse.

Agents have been shot dead for much, much less.

[ALBERT HASSEL BRANCH]

The muted thuds stops and from the wall you can hear a faint voice.

"Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?"

It's halfway between a whimper and a cry. You could swear it's.

"I heard you, at least I think I heard someone. Did you barf? I barfed too, when I ate the stuff that the warden put out there for me. I got it all over my shirt, too. Augh."

You haven't really been able to regain your ability to speak yet, but you can still hear this man from the next cell over.

[VARIANT 1]

"Listen, I ju-ju-just want you to listen, maybe you can help... or not. I don't know. My name is Albert. Albert Hassel. I work at an electronics factory." The voice from the next cell over calls out.

"I-I-I.. Oh, oh. All I want is to go back home. I didn't do anything wrong, ok? I just wanted to go o-o-on a holiday to Latvia. I didn't know it was-s-s wrong to do you know? I won't. I swear."

Albert pauses as you can hear him trying to move the cot and scratching the floor of the cell.

"I s-s-swear I won't leave the country ag-ag-again. I just wa-want to see my Na-Na-Nadine again. Yes, yes. I want to see - I wa-wa-want to see her. I wa-wa-want to see Nadine again. She's the nicest. The nicest y'know? The nicest. I seen her. I known her. Since grade school. She was so nice to me. Nadine. Where's Nadine? I want to se-se-see her. All this t-t-time, I see her grow and become m-m-more beautiful. And all these b-b-boys they went after her."

Hassel pauses to cry, but he tries to contain it and keep talking.

"They don't deserve her! I only - Me - I. I only know. I only truly know her. She's so nice. You should meet her. Yes you-you-you'd be delighted. But she's m-mine now. Nadine. Where are you? Nadine. Nadine. Whe-where are you? Nadine, please don't leave me." He sobs.

[VARIANT 2]

"Listen, I ju-ju-just want to say something, maybe you can help me... or something. I don't know, ok? I'm in jail. I don't know where I am. My name is Has-Has-Has-Hasalbert. Albert Ha-Ha-Hassel. I work at ah... Uh, it doesn't matter. N-n-no it doesn't matter." The voice from the next cell over calls out.

"Listen I-I-I. All I want is to g-g-go back ho-ho-home. I've g-gogot the swetst girl b-back home. Her n-name's Na-Na-Nadine. She's so nice. You should meet her. Yes you-you-you'd be delighted. But she's m-mine now. No touchy. No."

Albert pauses for a brief moment and continues to speak

"Y'nnow, were-were-were in school together. When t-twa-twas time to go to Po-poly-polytechnic skoo, she-she moved. And-d I never s-saw her ag-gain. It wa-was bad. I go. I go. S-s-tudy. And work. One d-d-day, five months. Five months. She c-c-comes back! And we-we see each o-o-other for lunch! A-aa-and then everything was great! The d-d-dancing! The cook-cooking! Everything. It was great. I just want to go back. Where-whe-where is she? Nadine. Nadine. Whe-where are you?"

[VARIANT 3]

"Na-Nad-Nadine? Is that you? I bet it's ye-ye-you Nadine. Yes. It's you Nad-Nadine. It's you." The voice moans. Now you recognize him.

"Nadine? Ple-please talk to me? Please? Nadine, please ta-ta-talk to me. I'm s-s-sorry. I'm sossos-ssorry. I swear. We can talk to them Sss-tasi. This is a mistake. I know i-i-its a mis-mis-mistake. I lo-love. I love you. S-s-so much. I-I-I just want to he-hear you. Ag-gain. Pl-please? Pl-please? You're the-the-there Nadine, ri-ri-right? Please? Talk to me N-nadine."

Hassel breaks out into loud sobbing.

"Na-nadine! Talk to me! I nn-eed to he-hear you! I nn-need to-to hear you s-s-say you love me! Please! Please! Nadine! Please!"

[VARIANT 4]

"Na-Nad-Nadine? Is that you? I bet it's ye-ye-you Nadine. Yes. It's you Nad-Nadine. It's you." The voice moans. Now you recognize him.

"Nadine? Ple-please talk to me? Please? Nadine, please ta-ta-talk to me. I'm s-s-sorry. I'm sossos-ssorry. I shoul-shoul-should have listened to my m-m-mother. You knn-now? Sh-she never li-li-liked you? I always t-to-told her, mama. That she was wrong. Ab-ab-about you. But n-no-no."

Hassel breaks out into loud sobbing.

"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. No! NO! NO! She was right! She was right about you! I should have never! Never! Never! Let you in my life again!" As before, when provoked. Hassel was a different person altogether.

"Nadine! I hope you're hearing this! Even if you're not over there, I hope you'll hear me! I regret ever meeting you! I hate you! And if I ever see you again I'll kill you and your whole damn family! I will! I will! When I get out I'll get you! I will!"

[NADINE LEITZKA BRANCH]

The muted thudding becomes more and more violent. Each one louder, each one more and more like they had detained you next to an unhinged animal. Or a person so ill that they might as well be.

The thudding stops and you hear shrieking, distinctively from a woman.

"I know you're there! I know you can hear me! Pigs! Hogs! All of you! I know you're there, you cowards! Let me out of here! Let me out! LET! ME! OOOOOUUUUUT!"

After that last invective, she falls completely silent. You recognize that voice. You've done nothing but listen to it all week.

"Hey. Hey-hey-hey." She says "You there, buddy. Buddy ol' pal in the cell next door. You don't mind if a lady vents for bit? A-as you can see, I'm quite... Quite agitated."

Not like you have much of a choice.

[VARIANT 1]

"I hope you're a guy. You're probably a guy, right? They usually lock guys up. Because, ya know, you guys are stupid enough to get yourselves locked up?"

She chuckles a bit before continuing. "Me? Well I guess I'm now stupid too. Stupid enough to believe that a guy would help me get out of here if I tried to convince him. He's such a sweetie, that Bertie. Too bad that he's such a boob."

Hers are strained fits of laughter, the act of putting a brave face above it all and falling. "Pfeh, he wishes he was as pleasant as one. He's so soft. So damn soft. But it's not even a nice soft. It's like a mattress that's so soft that you sink in it."

She pauses for a long time.

You swear you could hear the faintest sniffling before she continues talking. "I thought I could learn to love the man. He had it so hard for me too. So hard. It was so so obvious but it was so boring. But.. a lady could get used to that. If you can stomach making him three meals a day and polishing his pecker every so often. Perhaps the silver lining is that I get to be away from him and actually have a reason to be. I just wish it wasn't here."

[VARIANT 2]

"I miss mom. I miss Wennie. I miss her so much." She says in between pauses longer than you would expect. You could swear you heard some loud sniffing.

"Wennie. Mom. I wish I could see you right now. I wish I could have held you. I wish I would have had the money for that woman to ferry all of us so we could be together. Instead I have to stay. Otherwise they'd have noticed right away. And she needed to be gone. Oh, Mom? Where are you? Where are you Wennie? Are you two even alive? I don't even know anymore. You'd be dead and I wouldn't even know." She ends the last sentence with one very loud sob.

"Oh. Oh no. I can't no. No. No I can't cry. No. No-no-no-no. C'mon Nadine, C'mon. You've gotta pull yourself together. C'mon." She kept saying repeating over and over as she cried. Her words became increasingly incomprehensible. Her cries became muffled and blended into the noises of the jail.

[VARIANT 3]

You can hear her banging on the walls as she screams a top of her voice. "You win, Sessler! You win! If you can hear me, you win! Take me now, I'm yours! C'mon, you bald cow! I know you want me! This is your way to punish me for sure! I wanted to leave, and I wouldn't let you do me, so this is how it is huh?! Huh?!"

She continues to yell, even as she shreds her vocal chords to pieces. "Is this how you and your wife do it?! She's gotta know! She's gotta know the big bad Oskar Sessler makes more gravy than a soup kitchen! Is she into it?! I hope she does, or I will gladly swap places with her in the cell, I bet she'd love to be out of your sight! Do you hear me! Do you hear me Sessler! You bastard! I'm here! I'm naked right fucking now! Come on! COME ON! COME ON YOU FUCK!"

[VARIANT 4]

"Hey, guess what? My ma's books got me arrested! And if they haven't, they'll find them and fuck me like the best whore in Berlin!" She says in between whimpers and sobs.

"I wish she wouldn't have done that. But that's all she left me." The sobbing becomes louder. "Oh ma, ma... Where are you ma?" She says. You get the feeling she's not talking to you anymore.

"Why did you leave me? Why? Wh-why-why? Did you hate me? That's why Wennie didn't stay and I did? Wh-why would you leave me with your books ma? I wish you wouldn't have, that way I wouldn't know to wait for something better, ma. I wish you would have never told me, ma. I'd rather have you read them to me like we used to, ma. I miss you. I miss you and Wennie. I miss you both so, so, so much. I miss you. I mi-miss you. I just want to see you two again. Please. Oh, please. Please." Her pleads, become wails, which become sad, messy noises.

[END OF VARIANTS]

The loud of noise of your cell door interrupt both you and your interlocutor. The mass of air blown by the door hits you squarely in the face, and it forces you to squint.

"Get up." The figure on the door says.

You hesitate for a moment.

"Get up." He? She? Repeats. "It's time."

You scramble to get on your feet but they fail you terribly. It's like your legs are made out of gelatin. The warden comes in and starts dragging you by your clothes.

"C'mon you rat. Get up." He says. "It's time for you to face them." He hesitates for a moment as he looks at you.

"Agh, shit. Just look at you, barfing over yourself. And they told me you were an Agent for the Stasi." He groans. You feel that he thrusts in your hands something. It's a piece of cloth.

"Bring it with you, I'll escort you to the bathroom. You will want to wash yourself. They'll be seeing you now."

Who is they? They're the jury? Division IX?

You walk out of the cell, following the warden to the lavatory. The world in more focus now, you see you're in a standard guard tower. You'll probably be ushered into another room for an inter-Ministry hearing. You've been to them before. You know what they're about.

The warden stops at the end of a hallway and points you to the door.

You follow his directions, and beyond another loud metal door there's a sink with a faucet.

Odd, there's no mirror.

You look and you see that you just made a mess all over yourself. If you wipe it down, you'll look wet but at least presentable.

You open the faucet, and the sensation of cold water strangely invigorates you.

It ever so briefly reminds you of home.

A splash of water, and a towel make all the difference.

You put the towel over your eyes, and enjoy a darkness of which you finally have control. (run a script to play a gunshot and stop printing the sentence)

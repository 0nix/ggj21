# Hardline Sessler

The morning is brisk, but not uncomfortably so. You will not see the sun today, as it hides above a thick cloud blanket. 

Not the best weather one could possibly have, but one could imagine worse. The sky almost matches the stoic tint of the concrete towers surrounding you on all four sides.

The people congregated around the edges of a concrete yard, while in the center there was only a wooden pole driven into the ground.

They were all milling about as they await for the hour to strike seven o'clock. There was a mixture of Ministry agents and Soldiers in their dark tans and grayish greens respectively, some idly chatting by while others dutifully cleaned and serviced their rifles. Many of them look like they had not gotten quality time with their bed in days.

You could say the same for yourself. 

After the rush-job special operation was over, you had expected to slide in the usual beat of things. Spy work is quite monotonous when taken as a whole: Questioning suspects, collecting samples for analysis, doing the rounds on public microphones, checking in with local surveillance offices, the works.

A week passed, and you found your pile of tasks shortened considerably. So much so that you could get done with all of it in an hour or two. Life in general had suddenly become..

Pleasant. 

You were being paid to simply show up.

And it doesn't take a genius to figure out who is putting his finger on the scales.

"Brownie! Brownie, good thing I found you. Thought you'd miss the show!" A grackle voice calls from behind you, with a tinge of joy.

Speak of the cueball-headed devil.

"It's such a shame that we have to schedule these things so early in the morning." Lieutenant Oskar Sessler said with some exasperation before he closes in and whispers in your ear. 

"I don't know what kind of bumbling moron in the Politburo said that the Army is the only agency authorized to administrate firing squads." He continues as he rubs his hands together. "If they really wanted to rut out corruption in this country, the fat jerk that came up with that rule would be the first one on my list." 

It's not every day you hear a plot to harm a representative.

The Lieutenant cackles madly as he slaps your back. "I'm just joking Agent! C'mon, lighten up a little. You have to!" He says, boisterous in his gesticulation. 

Your face may have given yourself away. You can't bring yourself to laugh, you haven't really been given that option either. 

"If we started to arrest men in the Politburo for being fat jerks there would not be a single member left!" Sessler says with cragly chortles.

He stops as soon as he started, and gives you the death glare. "Agent, I said laugh. Laugh damn you."

[You chuckle politely.]

[You laugh raucously.]

[You guffaw elatedly.]

(The options don't matter. Just keep going.)

"That's the stuff," the Lieutenant says. "You've got to laugh. You'll end up like that black hole of humanity Bertholt Bayer if you don't."

Ah yes, Sergeant Bayer.

The righteous and incorruptible Bayer was not happy with you. 

When you, and him, and Sessler had reported your findings to Division IX, he was fit to explode like a runaway train. 

Division IX is a review board for standard and special investigative operations across State Security. The Ministry will not act unless a conviction is all but guaranteed. After all, the punishments you administered were not designed to deter, but rather to stamp out.

To eliminate.

To destroy.

Destroy what? Well, you'll see soon enough.

To make sure our record stays clean, and to prevent the Comrades working for Division IX to suffer from retaliation, nobody was allowed to know their identity or their rank. 

Your desk neighbors could be right next to you for years, decades, and you'd never know their real occupation. 

Their post in Division IX only disclosed to Division Heads, the Office of the Minister, and their closest allies in Division II Counter-Intelligence. They also had unclassified liaisons, who spoke on behalf of Division IX, which made secrecy much simpler. 

Bayer was one such liaison. And he made sure you knew about that the final day of the investigation.

Everyone heard him threaten you and the Lieutenant to be court-martialed. He called you every name under the sun.

"Vermin", "fascist" come to mind. "A blood-sucking lamprey stuck on the country's teat," as far as insults go, is quite the choice of words. 

The day after, you had found yourself tasked with a mountain menial, dull tasks that were beneath your station. Mail-opening, document-filing, note-transcribing tasks suitable for a wet-round-the-ears greenhorn.

For you? Not so much.

The accusations continued in writing, and from the way people looked at you in cafeteria at lunch time, they were starting to spread through word of mouth. 

Sessler must have caught wind of it too, because after that week, it was as if the fairies looked your way and magicked all your troubles away.

Bayer had nothing for his case, and you made sure of it.

Because the man currently shoving you to your place in formation was the fairy that had mate it all happen, the nastiest spider in the agency, your real boss.

"I never get tired of these." The Lieutant says with glee.

The amorphous agglomeration of people coalesced quickly fell in formation. They stood in neat little rows and columns, lining up against the walls of the concrete yard.

An Army infantryman with an immaculately pressed uniform marched forward into the quad, and stood still. He looked around and found the silence that surrounded him pleasing.

"Atteeeen-tion!" He bellowed. Everyone stood in formation. Looking straight. Hands on your side. Straight as an arrow.

"Firing Squad! Preseeeeent arms!" The armed men unslinged their rifles and, in a synchronized motion, brandished their weapons in front of them.

Out the corner of your eye you could see Sessler grinning. You swear if he felt he could talk, he would start to cackle.

"Citizens, Comrades, Defenders of the Fatherland. We are here to enforce justice. We are here to punish those who have aimed to destroy the peace of our fair nation, and to deter those who would desire to do the same." The infantryman hollers, his voice billowing wisps of vapor into the cold air.

"As determined by the Courts of Justice, the man known as Albert Hassel has been found guilty of crimes against the state. The punishment for these crimes shall be execution by firing squad. Will the warden bring the prisoner so that he may face his fate?" He continues, motioning towards the door  to the tower on your left.

On cue, a metal door swings open.

You could immediately hear the fight and struggle inside. 

"No, no, no! You can't do this to me! You can't! I swear, I-I-I didn't do anything! I swear!" you hear a whiny voice, faint but clear enough to make out.

"Will the warden bring the prisoner so that he may face his fate?" The infantryman repeats, deliberately leaning on the last words as if he was an actor prompting his colleague to act on cue.

"I'm telling you, I'm not guilty! I've done nothing! No! No! Please, no!" The voice mewls.

"You will follow protocol, traitor, or so help me God you're going to wish for the firing squad when I'm done with you!" Another voice, a gruffer one, responds from the inside of the tower. 

"Please no I-" you hear the pleading voice cry out before being interrupted by the sound of a swinging pistol.

-WHACK-

"Auugh!"

-WHACK-

"Please, no, no more!"

-WHACK-

"Mercy! Mercy! I'll do anything!"

You see a group of four or five irritated wardens dragging a sniveling and floundering Albert Hassel across the prison yard grounds. 

His hair is unkempt and disordered. His entire body squirms like an eel. He kicks his feet as he tries to get a grip on the ground. His eyes are completely wide open, almost bulging out of his head. His clothes look like they had been gnawed on by some kind of animal. His face is red and swollen in different places and his nose effuses a mixture of snot and blood.

"N-no! No! I don't want to die! Not like this! Please no! No! No!" He whimpers as the wardens drag him onto the quad by every extremity and fabric fold they could, a pudgy little bird trying squirm and free itself from the grip of an eagle about to eat it. 

"No! Please you have to believe me! Oh God, I can't! No, I can't! Not like this!" Hassel cries as he looks around for a sympathetic person in the crowd. The wardens finally drag him to the wooden pole. With firm grip, they tie his hands behind his back and fit him on the wooden pole. He thrashes and bawls trying to free himself every second, bludgeoned by the blunt ends of the weapons of his jailers.

-THWACK-

"You have to believe me, please. No, no, n-"

-THWACK-

"I have rights! I have righ-"

-THWACK-

"I beg you. Mercy. I beg you mercy. Please."

Even as he tries, he cannot break the ropes. This sobbing blubbery mess of a man called Albert Hassel was now tied to the pole.

"Albert Hassel. You have been found guilty of High Treason, Conspiracy against the Government, and harboring anti-citizen behaviors. The court--" The Army man vociferates.

"NO! YOU'RE WRONG! I CAN PROVE IT!" Albert Hassel exclaims at the top of his lungs. He's loud enough that it echoes on the walls towering all of you. The Army man is taken aback quite a bit. You can tell he has never been interrupted like this.

"I have information! I have it! Yes I do! I can serve this country! Pl-pl-please let me!" Hassel cries, his vocal chords torn to shreds.

"Enough!" The Army man roars. "The court has determined that your punishment shall be death by firing squad. By the time the minute strikes seven and ten minutes, you shall be fired upon until you die. State your last words."

Albert Hassel was a man possessed to make every single effort to break free from his restraints. His entire body convulsed in increasingly violent fits. He was a desperate animal wearing human skin.

[VARIANT 1]

"I can tell you! I'll tell you! You're looking for Gerhart Kleiner! He's the day-shift head at the Electronics Factory! He's hiding shipments on the warehouses! If you go look right now you're going to find boxes full of stuff we were supposed to ship out! Nobody is working right now! And they're getting paid! Nobody is working-"

"Readyyy Weapons!"

"Wait! Wait! I helped him out! I swear I was just being told what to do! I didn't want to go ahead but he made me do it! I wanted to report him, I swear I-I-I I wanted to report him but I was so scared! So s-s-scared! I'll nev-nev-never do it again! I swear!"

"Taaaake aim!"

"No no no no! Please God no! I'll show you!! I'll be an in-in-informant! I'll do anything!! I will gib-gib-give you all the names! Throw me in a cell! I promise I'll be good!" 

Silence. Albert Hassel realizes this is the end. He thrashes and contorts, screaming atop of his lungs, looking down the gun barrels with his face completely contorted by the horror of what was to come.

"PLEASE MERCY OH GOD PLEASE OH GOD MER-"

[VARIANT 2]

"My neighbor! My neighbor! You need to look into Laurie. Laurie Wei-wei-weiss! She goes over t-t-to the West side every weekend! It's because of her husband, he's-s a-a-a crossing guard! I'll tell you ev-ev-everything. Everything! I'll be an in-in-informant, I swear I have-"

"Readyyy Weapons!" 

"Wait! Wait! I've even over-over-overheard them! They're the real threat! They plan on smug-smug-smuggling western propaganda! That's why they cross ev-ev-every week, to bri-bri-bring as much contraband as they c-c-can! And then they s-s-sell it! Out of their flat! They tried to sell me books! Evil books! Bad, evil books! They are the traitors, not me! If you let me go I c-can-"

"Taaaake aim!"

"They sell ch-ch-children! They're s-s-sodomites! They poi-poi-poison food in the supermarkets! They give guns t-t-to criminals! They d-d-do it! They do i-i-it all! I'll show you! I'll sh-sh-show you! Let me serve this country! Let this-s-s humble citizen serve you! Please! Are you mnmn-nnot the protectors of the Fatherland!? Let me prot-t-tect it too! Please! Let me="

Silence. Albert Hassel realizes this is the end. He thrashes and contorts, screaming atop of his lungs, looking down the gun barrels with his face completely contorted by the horror of what was to come.

"PLEASE NOT ME PLEASE OH GOD N-"

[VARIANT 3]

"It's that woman. Nadine! Nadine Leitzka! She put all those books in my flat, all those pamphlets! I was trying to get her to see the error. The error of her ways! But I can see! I can see clearly now! There's no redemption for a traitor! I can show you where she lives! I can show you where she goes!"

"Readyyy Weapons!"

"Wait! Wait! There's more! There's more! She brought them to my house! She brought rebels to my house! I was gathering names, faces! For justice! I have them, I have their names! You want traitors right?! You want to kill them all, right?! I have traitors for you! If you spare I will give them to you!"

"Taaaake aim!"

"I hope you're here Nadine! I hope you can hear me! They know now honey! They know all about you and your little friends! I hope it was worth it! I hope all the times you let me inside you was worth it! You live like a rat you will die like a rat! I hope they drag you to hell where I'll see you and I'll flay you alive myself! You're next bitch! You're next!"

Silence. Albert Hassel realizes this is the end. He swings his head up towards the skies, opens his mouth, and bellows at the heavens.

"FUCK YOU NADINE LEITZKAAA-"

[END VARIANTS]

"Fire!" The infantryman bellows.

The bullet volley deafens you and everyone else around the prison yard. The smell of gunpowder fills the air. In the blink of an eye, you see the projectiles connect with Albert Hassel's body. The bullets hit him in the torso, and he lets out something between a scream and a wet gurgle. His face has one or two holes in it, permanently disfiguring him. Not that it will matter much. Small pools of blood start to form around Hassel's feet.

"Fire!" The infantryman bellows.

The sound second volley buries itself deep in your ear canal. You can see Albert Hassel take the shots, the reddening all of his clothes, his body creating rivulets. The pressure spigots of his bodily fluids spray the concrete floor. His mouth only produces a red, organic sludge of blood, vomit, and saliva. His chest looks like a clogged up colander.

"Fire!" The infantryman bellows yet again.

The foul smell of emptying bowels fills your nostrils. Hassel's body keeps taking the shots, as it slumps forward, loosing all manner of self-directed movement. His belly folds splay and slosh as the bullets puncture more and more holes. If he wasn't already dead before, there is no doubt he is now.

But that is not enough.

"Fire!" The infantryman bellows once more, as the riflemen reduce the once-living man into a pile of his own refuse, bones, and meat. They do this at least ten more times, with increasingly more disgusting descriptions that you dare not tell yourself.

Bits and crumbs of organs litter the floor of the yard. They flow outwards into gutters, creating a large bloody blot.

Considering this is a normal execution, you have to wonder how much and how long do they take in order to clean the quad to make it look pristine as it was just a few minutes ago.

Well, as pristine as a prison yard can be.

"Fire!" The infantryman bellows for the last time. The firing squad men pull their triggers. And the pile of human thing tied to the poll moves like a sickly, blobby gelatin.

It's over.

Albert Hassel is dead.

The volleys still resonate in your ears, and you can still hear the Army Infantryman's voice. "Doctor! Please, confirm the procedure!" 

From the crowd, a ghoulish man emerges wearing a cloth mask and gloves. He walks to the center of the quad at a brisk pace. He rummages around the body, presumably to find a neck or a wrist. He sticks his fingers in one the many holes made by the bullets. 

He hesitates for a moment, and he nudges what was once Albert Hassel with his foot. 

"GGGHGGGGK" you can somebody stiffling their laughter. Something between a gargle and a large mouse squeaking.

You turn to see Lieutenant Sessler, with a toothless smile from ear to ear.

You fail the find the amusement in the situation, in some manner of way you agree with the man. It's all so... perfunctory.

If a man survived that many gunshots, he would be an asset not a liability.

"He's dead!" The doctor declares, as if there was any doubt.

"At ease!" The infantryman orders, and the firing squad breaks formation, slinging their rifles on their backs as they do.

The army infantry man turns to the public gathered to see a man die. "Justice has been served! Such are the wages of those who commit treason! Recruits, burn this into your minds! Anyone can be a traitor! Anyone!"

He pauses a moment to continue. "There is no such thing as a citizen who is not tempted, there is no such thing as a man who is above reproach. A prior history is not needed to become an enemy of this state! A lifetime of apparent loyalty is not indication of a man above reproach! We must remain vigilant from our first day, till our last!"

"That is our duty!" He proclaims as he thrusts his hand into the air.

The crowd cheers.

"That is our enterprise!" He bellows.

The crowd hurrahs.

"For the Fatherland!" He roars.

The crowd responds in kind. "For the Fatherland!" they proclaim. 

"We are done," the infantryman says in a triumphant tone. "resume your duties, people."

The crowd breaks formation and starts heading for the exits. "Let's scram," Sessler whispers in our ear. "Meet me at the gates, ten minutes. I've got just the thing to celebrate."

You file in the building with the others. Out of the corner of your eye you can see one man scrub the floor with lye, and another man and push the remains around with a shovel.

The ringing in your ears doesn't leave you for several minutes.

In your normal goings on, you had not really stopped to think about how would your superior's home would look like. Though, if someone asked, you would say that Lieutenant Oskar Sessler

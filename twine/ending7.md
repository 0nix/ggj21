# Hardline Sessler

The morning is brisk, but not uncomfortably so. You will not see the sun today. It hides above a thick blanket of clouds.

You have been through worse weather. The hues above you match the stoic tint of the concrete towers surrounding you on all four sides.

The people congregate around the edges of a concrete yard, while in the center there is only a wooden pole driven into the ground.

They are all milling about as they wait for the hour to strike seven o'clock. There is a mixture of Ministry agents and Soldiers in their dark tans and grayish greens respectively, some idly chatting by while others dutifully clean and service their rifles. Many of them look like they have not gotten quality time with their bed in days.

You could say the same for yourself.

After the rush-job special operation was over, you had expected to slide into the usual beat of things. Spy work is quite monotonous when taken as a whole: Taking pictures, collecting ephemera, doing the rounds on public microphones, checking in with local surveillance offices, the works.

A week passed after you delivered your report, and you found your pile of tasks shortened considerably. So much so that you could get done with all of it in an hour or two. Life in general had suddenly become..

Pleasant. Suspiciously so.

You were being paid to simply show up.

And it doesn't take a genius to figure out who is putting their finger on the scales.

"Brownie! Brownie, good thing I found you. Thought you'd miss the show!" A grackle voice calls from behind you, with a tinge of joy.

Speak of the cueball-headed devil.

"It's such a shame that we have to schedule these things so early in the morning." Lieutenant Oskar Sessler says with some exasperation before he closes in and whispers in your ear.

"I don't know what kind of bumbling moron in the Politburo said that the Army is the only agency authorized to administrate firing squads." He continues as he rubs his hands together. "If they really wanted to rut out corruption in this country, the fat jerk that came up with that rule would be the first one on my list."

It's not every day you are casually informed of a plot to harm a duly elected representative.

The Lieutenant waits for a few moments before he starts to cackle, madly."I'm just joking Agent! C'mon, lighten up a little. You have to!" He says, boisterous in his gesticulation as he slaps your back.

Your face may have given yourself away. You cannot bring yourself to laugh, even when it was not particularly optional.

"If we started to arrest men in the Politburo for being fat jerks there wouldn't be a single member left!" Sessler says with craggy chortles.

He stops as soon as he started, and gives you the death glare. "Agent, I said laugh. Laugh damn you."

[You chuckle politely.]

[You laugh raucously.]

[You guffaw elatedly.]

(The options don't matter. Just keep going.)

"That's the stuff," the Lieutenant says. "You've got to laugh. You'll end up like that black hole of humanity Bertholt Bayer if you don't."

Ah yes, Sergeant Bayer.

The righteous and incorruptible Bayer was not happy with you.

When you and your superiors had reported your findings to Division IX, he was fit to explode like a runaway train.

Division IX is a review board for standard and special investigative operations across State Security. The Ministry will not act unless a conviction is all but guaranteed. After all, the punishments you administered were not designed to rehabilitate offenders, they were meant to eliminate them.

If you wore any sign or seal of the government of this country, you borrowed from the fear and respect that all your colleagues, and all the people before you had cultivated with zeal and precision. And so it is your job, and the job of everyone around you, to carry that forward.

Any flinching, any at all, and there would be no telling of what civilians would do to you.

For such punitive strength, we needed to make sure our record stays clean. To prevent comrades working for Division IX to suffer from retaliation, nobody was allowed to know their identity or their rank.

Your neighbors across the desk could be there for years, decades, and you would never know their real occupation.

Their post in Division IX is only disclosed to Division Heads, the Office of the Minister, and their closest allies in Division II Counter-Intelligence. They also had unclassified liaisons, who spoke on behalf of Division IX, which made secrecy much simpler.

Bayer was one such liaison. And, he made sure you knew that.

Everyone heard him threaten you and the Lieutenant to be court-martialed. He called you every name imaginable.

"Vermin" and "fascist" come to mind.  You were called "a blood-sucking lamprey stuck on the country's teat" too. As far as insults go, that was quite the choice of words.

The day after, you found yourself tasked with a mountain of menial tasks that were beneath your station. Mail-opening, document-filing, note-transcribing tasks suitable for a wet-round-the-ears greenhorn.

For you? Not so much.

The accusations continued in writing through company memos, official summons papers, and itty-bitty notes your desk. From the way people looked at you in cafeteria at lunch time, they started to spread through word of mouth.

Even after all that, after hearing in so many words how you and you alone would bring the entire German Democratic Republic to its knees, you never heard of the radical group ever again. No bomb was planted. No tragedy was suffered. If anything, right now you were the biggest victim of United Left. The state should be protecting you at this point.

Lieutenant Sessler caught wind of what was going on. You had not seen him since the debriefing, but there's no other explanation for what happened next. 

After one week of Bayer's foot pressing on your head, it was as if the fairies looked your way and magicked all your troubles away.

The Sergeant had nothing for his case, and you made sure of it. Your reward was the favor of the man currently shoving you to your place in formation. He was the fairy that had made it all happen.

The nastiest spider in the agency.

Your real boss.

"I never get tired of these." The Lieutenant says with glee.

The amorphous agglomeration of people quickly fall in formation. They stand in neat little rows and columns, lining up against the walls of the concrete yard.

An Army infantryman with an immaculately pressed uniform marches forward into the quad, and stands still. He looks around and found the silence that surrounds him pleasing.

"Atteeeen-tion!" He bellows. Everyone stands in formation. Looking straight. Hands on your side. Straight as an arrow.

"Firing Squad! Preseeeeent arms!" The armed men unsling their rifles and, in a synchronized motion, brandish their weapons in front of them.

Out the corner of your eye you can see Sessler grinning. You swear if he felt he could talk, he would start to cackle.

"Citizens, Comrades, Defenders of the Fatherland. We are here to enforce justice. We are here to punish those who have aimed to destroy the peace of our fair nation, and to deter those who would desire to do the same." The infantryman hollers, his voice billowing wisps of vapor into the cold air.

"As determined by the Courts of Justice, the man known as Albert Hassel has been found guilty of crimes against the state. The punishment for these crimes shall be execution by firing squad. Will the warden bring the prisoner out so that he may face his fate?" He continues, motioning towards the door to the tower on your left.

On cue, a metal door swings open.

You can immediately hear the fight and struggle inside.

"No, no, no! You can't do this to me! You can't! I swear, I-I-I didn't do anything! I swear!" you hear a whiny voice, faint but clear enough to make out.

"Will the warden bring the prisoner so that he may face his fate?" The infantryman repeats, deliberately leaning on the last words as if he was an actor prompting his colleague to say his next lines.

"I'm telling you, I'm not guilty! I've done nothing! No! No! Please, no!" The voice mewls.

"You will follow protocol, traitor, or so help me God you're going to wish for the firing squad after I'm done with you!" Another voice, a gruffer one, responds from the inside of the tower.

"Please no I-" you hear the pleading voice cry out before being interrupted by the sound of a swinging pistol.

-WHACK-

"Auugh!"

-WHACK-

"Please, no, no more!"

-WHACK-

"Mercy! Mercy! I'll do anything!"

You see a group of four or five irritated wardens dragging a sniveling and floundering Albert Hassel across the prison yard grounds.

His hair is unkempt and disordered. His entire body squirms like an eel. He kicks his feet as he tries to get a grip on the ground. His eyes are completely wide open, almost bulging out of his head. His clothes look like they had been gnawed on by a rabid animal. His face is red and swollen in different places and his nose effuses a mixture of snot and blood.

"N-no! No! I don't want to die! Not like this! Please no! No! No!" He whimpers as the wardens drag him onto the quad by every extremity and piece of fabric they could, a pudgy little bird trying to squirm -- to free itself from the grip of an eagle about to eat it.

"No! Please you have to believe me! Oh God, I can't! No, I can't! Not like this!" Hassel cries as he looks around for a sympathetic person in the crowd. The wardens finally drag him to the wooden pole. With firm grip, they tie his hands behind his back and fit him on the wooden pole. He thrashes and bawls trying to free himself every second, bludgeoned by the blunt ends of his gaolers' weapons.

-THWACK-

"You have to believe me, please. No, no, n-"

-THWACK-

"I have rights! I have righ-"

-THWACK-

"I beg you. Mercy! I beg you mercy! Please!"

Even as he tries, he cannot break the ropes. This sobbing blubbery mess of a man called Albert Hassel is now tied to the pole.

"Albert Hassel. You have been found guilty of High Treason, Conspiracy against the Government, and harboring anti-citizen behaviors. The court--" The Army man vociferates.

"NO! YOU'RE WRONG! I CAN PROVE IT!" Albert Hassel exclaims at the top of his lungs. He's loud enough that it echoes on the walls towering all of you. The Army man is taken aback quite a bit. You can tell he has never been interrupted like this.

"I have information! I have it! Yes I do! I can serve this country! Pl-pl-please let me!" Hassel cries, his vocal chords torn to shreds.

"Enough!" The Army man roars. "The court has determined that your punishment shall be death by firing squad. At ten past the hour, you shall be fired upon until you die. State your last words."

Albert Hassel was a man possessed to make every single effort to break free from his restraints. His entire body convulsed in increasingly violent fits. He was a desperate animal wearing human skin.

[VARIANT 1]

"I can tell you! I'll tell you! You're looking for Gerha-ha-hart Kleiner! He's the day-shift head at the Elec-electronics Factory! He's hiding sh-sh-shipments on the warehouses! If you go look right now you're going to find boxes ff-ff-full of stuff we were supposed to ship out! Nobody is working right now! A-a-and they're getting paid! Nobody is working-"

"Readyyy Weapons!"

"Wait! Wait! I helped him out! I swear I was just being told what to do! I didn't want to go ahead but he made me do it! I wanted to rep-rep-report him, I swear I-I-I I wanted to report him but I was so scared! So s-s-scared! I'll nev-nev-never do it again! I swear!"

"Taaaake aim!"

"No no no no! Please God no! I'll show you!! I'll be an in-in-informant! I'll do anything!! I will gib-gib-give you all the names! Throw me in a cell! I promise I'll be good!"

Silence. Albert Hassel realizes this is the end. He thrashes and contorts, screaming atop of his lungs, looking down the gun barrels with his face completely contorted by the horror of what was to come.

"PLEASE MERCY OH GOD PLEASE OH GOD MER-"

[VARIANT 2]

"My neighbor! My neighbor! You need to look into Laurie. Laurie Wei-wei-weiss! She goes over t-t-to the West side every weekend! It's because of her husband, he's-s a-a-a crossing guard! I'll tell you ev-ev-everything. Everything! I'll be an in-in-informant, I swear I have-"

"Readyyy Weapons!"

"Wait! Wait! I've even over-over-overheard them! They're the real threat! They plan on smug-smug-smuggling western propaganda! That's why they cross ev-ev-every week, to bri-bri-bring as much contraband as they c-c-can! And then they s-s-sell it! Out of their flat! They tried to sell me books! Pornography! They are the traitors, not me! If you let me go I c-can-"

"Taaaake aim!"

"They sell ch-ch-children! They're s-s-sodomites! They poi-poi-poison food in the supermarkets! They give guns t-t-to criminals! They d-d-do it! They do i-i-it all! I'll show you! I'll sh-sh-show you! Let me serve this country! Let this-s-s humble citizen serve you! Please! Are you mnmn-nnot the protectors of the Fatherland!? Let me prot-t-tect it too! Please! Let me="

Silence. Albert Hassel realizes this is the end. He thrashes and contorts, screaming atop of his lungs, looking down the gun barrels with his face completely contorted by the horror of what was to come.

"PLEASE NOT ME PLEASE OH GOD N-"

[VARIANT 3]

"It's that woman. Nad-Nad-Nadine! Nadine Leitzka! She put all those book-boo-books in my flat, all those pamphlets! I was trying to g-g-get her to see th-th-the error. The error of her ways! But I-I-I can see! I can see clearly now! There's no red-red-redemption for a traitor! I can sh-sh-show you where she lives! I can show you where she goes!"

"Readyyy Weapons!"

"Wait! Wait! There's m-m-more! There's more! She brought them to my house! She brought re-re-rebels to my house! I was gathering na-na-names, faces! For justice! I have them, I have their nn-names! You want traitors right?! You wa-wa-want to kill them all, right?! I have traitors for you! If you spare me I will give them to you!"

"Taaaake aim!"

"I hope you're here Nadine! I hope you can hear me! They know now honey! They know all about you and your little friends! I hope it was worth it! I hope all the times you let me inside you were worth it! I hope they drag you to hell where I'll see you and I'll flay you alive myself! You're next, bitch! You're next!"

Silence. Albert Hassel realizes this is the end. He swings his head up towards the skies, opens his mouth, and bellows at the heavens.

"FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FU-"

[END VARIANTS]

"Fire!" The infantryman bellows.

The bullet volley deafens you and everyone else around the prison yard. The smell of gunpowder fills the air. In the blink of an eye, you see the projectiles connect with Albert Hassel's body. The bullets hit him in the torso, and he lets out something between a scream and a wet gurgle. His face has one or two holes in it, permanently disfiguring him. Not that it will matter much. Small pools of blood start to form around Hassel's feet.

"Fire!" The infantryman bellows.

The sound of the second volley buries itself deep in your ear canal. You can see Albert Hassel take the shots, the reddening all of his clothes, his body is like a blood-filled balloon with dozens of holes. The pressure spigots of his bodily fluids spray the concrete floor. His mouth only produces a red, organic sludge of blood, vomit, and saliva. His chest looks like a clogged-up drain at an abattoir.

"Fire!" The infantryman bellows yet again.

The foul smell of emptying bowels fills your nostrils. Hassel's body keeps taking the shots, as it slumps forward, loosing all manner of self-directed movement. His belly folds splay and slosh as the bullets puncture more and more holes. If he wasn't already dead before, there is no doubt he is now.

But that is not enough.

"Fire!" The infantryman bellows once more, as the riflemen reduce the man into a pile of his own refuse, bones, and meat.

"Fire!"

"Fire!"

"Fire!"

They do this at least ten more times, with increasingly more disgusting descriptions that you dare not tell yourself.

Bits and pieces of organs litter the floor of the yard. They flow outwards into gutters, creating a large bloody blot.

Considering this is a normal execution, you have to wonder how much and how long do they take in order to clean the quad to make it look pristine as it was just a few minutes ago.

Well, as pristine as a prison yard can be.

"FIREEEE!" The infantryman bellows for the last time. The firing squad men pull their triggers. And, the pile of human thing tied to the pole moves like a sickly, blobby gelatin.

It's over.

Albert Hassel must be dead.

The volleys resonate in your ears, and you can still hear the Army Infantryman's voice. "Doctor! Please, confirm the procedure!"

From the crowd, a ghoulish man emerges wearing a cloth mask and gloves. He walks to the center of the quad at a brisk pace. He rummages around the body, presumably to find a neck or a wrist. He sticks his fingers in one the many holes made by the bullets.

He hesitates for a moment, and he nudges what was once Albert Hassel with his foot.

"GGGHGGKKKK" you can hear somebody stifling their laughter. Something between a gargle and a large mouse squeaking.

You turn to see Lieutenant Sessler, with a yellow smile from ear to ear.

Somehow, you are also able find the amusement in the situation as well. It's all so... perfunctory.

If a man survived that many gunshots, he would be an asset not a liability.

"He's dead!" The doctor declares, as if there was any doubt.

"At ease!" The infantryman orders, and the firing squad breaks formation, slinging their rifles on their backs as they do.

The army infantry man turns to the public gathered to see a man die. "Justice has been served! Such are the wages of those who commit treason! Recruits, burn this into your minds! Anyone can be a traitor! Anyone!"

He pauses a moment to continue, making sure he held his audiences' full attention. "There is no such thing as a citizen who is not corruptible, there is no such thing as a man who is above reproach. One toe off the path of justice is all it takes to become our enemy! A lifetime of loyalty is not an indication of a man without sin! And so, we must remain vigilant from our first day, till our last! We will purge ourselves from the malignant rebel, the hateful bourgeois, and the hidden traitor!"

"That is our duty!" He proclaims as he thrusts his hand into the air.

The crowd cheers.

"That is our enterprise!" He bellows.

The crowd hurrahs.

"For the Fatherland!" He roars.

The crowd responds in kind. "For the Fatherland!" they proclaim, their cheers bouncing off the prison walls and into your ears.

"We are done," the infantryman says in a triumphant tone. "as you were."

The crowd breaks formation and starts heading for the exits. "Let's get out of here," Sessler whispers in our ear. "Meet me at the gates after seven. I've got just the thing to celebrate."

You file in the building with the others. Out of the corner of your eye you can see one man scrub the floor with lye, and another man and push the remains around with a shovel.

The ringing in your ears will not leave you.

...

...

...

The city looks like an indigo and black canvas, with a thousand different amber and yellow lights piercing the inky mass.

You step out of Oskar Sessler's slick, black, immaculately kept Sachsenring P240 and into the streets of a neighborhood you've never had a good reason to be. Even the air tasted different in your mouth, as if you were supposed to pay for the privilege of breathing it. 

It wasn't obvious at the outset, of course. To flaunt power and wealth out in the open would be anathema to the very foundation of this country. The flats and houses looked like the ones you would live in. However, you can tell. Everyone can tell. Anyone who's lived and suffered here long enough can tell this place is different.

You look back to see the Lieutenant hunched over, talking about something or other with his chauffeur. The paint on the car was so incredibly shiny and reflective that even under the dimly lit sky, you could see your reflection stretched out on the metal body.

[IF GENDER IS MALE]

The face looking back at you is a cartoonish facsimile of what a man's face should be. Every wrinkle around your eyes and mouth is a snarky reminder of the passage of time. You have a visible stubble, one that had never done you the favor of fully growing into a beard or mustache. It's a mediocre showing of testosterone and, sadly, it will never get any better. You have to tilt your head forward to find your hairline. You try to find your eyes in the reflection, but they were nowhere to be found. They are too sunken in, and the skin around them is dark.

[IF GENDER IS FEMALE]

The face looking back at you is a stretched out plasticine mold of what a woman's face should be. You have way too many wrinkles, and every single one of them seemed to accuse you of being both responsible for and victim of the passage of time. You have make up on, but just barely. You definitely over did the blush on your cheeks. You play with your hair a bit, its ends split, dry like tumbleweed. Same color too. Your eyes sink into their sockets, so much so that in the darkness of this makeshift mirror you can't seem them.  

[END] (visual gimmick, the face is shifting and swirling, blotted out. The text says one thing, the visuals another.)

"Are you done admiring yourself Agent?" Lieutenant Sessler quips behind you, the loud jingle of a keyring punctuating the question. "There's plenty of ways to look at yourself inside, I promise you. Wanlass here has places to be."

You stand at attention and turn around to see an open door and a beckoning Oskar Sessler. A hand wave from the Lieutenant, and the car careens away from the curb and down the street.

...

...

...

You didn't even know where to lay your eyes.

Every corner and every surface around you is covered in some sort of reflective surface: Gilded mirrors, polished brass sconces, and sumptuously ornate bass reliefs of various propaganda posters done in silvered metal. Above you there was a chandelier that looked like it would collapse if there was one more crystal hanging from it. The couches look like they rolled off the factory the day before.

Under all the gaudy and shiny objects, you could see wood paneling that would not go out of place in your apartment. And, from the looks of things, that was an unacceptable proposition.

"Please take a seat, Brownie." The Lieutenant says as he motions towards the slick leather seats.

You oblige as you continue to look around your surroundings.  Two couches face a fireplace, and above it hangs a painting. A realistic rendering of Lieutenant Sessler in dress uniform, and a woman that looked somewhat familiar to you. 

The painter truly made an effort to make the man to look pleasing, but that was a task that was probably beyond even the most skilled artist. Below it, pictures of past exploits and medals emblazoned with the sheaf of wheat, the compass, and the hammer.

"Let us toast, Brownie. I think we can drop the formalities for a bit." The Lieutenant says with some difficulty, glasses and bottles clinking in his hands. On one hand, a large rectangular bottle with a liquor you've never heard of, two glasses and a small black ice box in the other. 

"To loyalty." He mutters as he pours himself a glass of this swirling clear liquid, on the rocks.

"To justice." He mutters as he pours you a glass of your own.

"And," he continues his toast with a raised glass. "to catching every rat bastard no matter how well they hide." You raise yours to clink. 

The sound they made was like a visitation from the fairies   drinking and making merry 'round the Hall.

And yet, Oskar Sessler cannot even sip a drink without sounding as if the liquor itself retched in disgust.

"You ever had this, Brownie? The best aperitif to open a meal for heroes." The Lieutenant grunts as he knocks back some more. The flavor that meets your lips is fragrant and somewhat sweet, citric. You've never had an orange-flavored liquor before.

"I gather as much. Don't think there is a bar this side of Berlin that would serve you French stuff and not charge you an arm and a le-BWAAAAAAAP-GHKKKKK." 

Oskar Sessler interrupts his soliloquy to burp and clear his throat. Both with his mouth wide open. You could see his yellowed incisors, his blackened molars, his sickly greenish throat.

"You've gotta know somebody, Brownie. There is always somebody with a hole in their pocket, and lately lots of people barely have two coins to rub together." He continues.

"We've got another ten or fifteen minutes before dinner's ready." The Lieutenant says as slams the glass on a tiny table beside him and pours himself another one. You're midway done with your first. "I don't care to talk shop with the missus around. Spoils the food. So, before that happens let me tell you a little secret." He murmurs with tiny smirk.

He scarfs down the entire glass like he had just found an oasis in the middle of the desert.

[VARIANT 1]

That woman, Nadine Leitzka?

*reveals that he had met Leitzka and screwed her, she's her property*

[VARIANT 2]

*reveals he was responsible to get Lietzka's family out of the GDR. nadine was supposed to be his payment*

[VARIANT 3]

*he was supposed to be in* sgt bayer's position but was ousted  by upper mgmt 

[END OF VARIANTS]

"It's a good drink right?" Sessler remarks smugly, pointing at his glass and yours. You nod ever so slightly, and he grabs the amber bottle and starts shaking it at you. "You can have it. Take the bottle with you." He shakes it a bit more before you grab it with some caution.

"Oh I can promise you, there will be more." The Lieutenant says with a smile. "After all, we have more to celebrate. After all, a hero's welcome is warranted for the new and shiny Sergeant Brownie. Heheheheheh." His grackle laugh is only interrupted by one more swig of his drink.

[EXTRA INFO if picked and pitched Sonia, it's revealed that its Bayer's wife]

"Dinner's ready, Oskar!" A female voice calls from a kitchen door, out of sight. "Aah! Edith! Pop out, say hi to our guest!" Sessler responds with cheer.

A portly woman steps briefly into the dining rooms, waves her hand, and gives you a smile. "Herr Brownie isn't it? I hope that's not your real name, but I do know my husband is quite fond giving people nicknames." She was a woman in her forties, her sweat beading around her face and taking her caked-on makeup with it. Under her apron she was covered from head to toe in black clothes. 

You looked at the painting of Sessler and his wife. That was a picture of her. You look back at Edith, at the painting, and back again. She seemed familiar at first, and now you know why.

You had met this woman before, but not named Edith.

With another brief smile, she excuses herself and goes back to the kitchen. 

[NO EXTRA INFO]

"Dinner's ready, Oskar!" A female voice calls from a kitchen door, out of sight. "Aah! Edith! Pop out, say hi to our guest!" Sessler responds with cheer.

"This really does require my full attention Oskar, I'll greet our guest properly once we are ready for dinner." This Edith responded in this matter-of-fact way.

"Suit yourself." Oskar Sessler responds with some exasperation.

[END OF EXTRA INFO]

Suddenly, Sessler snaps his fingers, a sparkle in his eye. "Ah! How could I forget, Sergeant Brownie. I've got one more thing to show you. Come along, you'll enjoy the surprise."

With a pep in his step, Sessler gets up and beckons you to follow. He stops at a special door. It had a larger frame, and the door itself looked very heavy. An important room, no doubt, as it was heavily padlocked. 

One by one, the locks clanged as Lieutenant Sessler jostled his keys, opened the locks and threw them on the ground. With every lock undone, he giggled a bit. Like a little kid about to open his Christmas presents from the West.

With a loud creak, the door finally opens. He beckons you to enter, with the same grin that he flashed in the morning.

The inside of the room is pitch black, interrupted by tricks of the light that give you an idea of what's in here, but not enough to be conclusive.

Your eyes struggle to adapt to the darkness, as the light behind you casts a long shadow in front of you. The room is deceivingly big, almost as large as the living room you were just sitting in. 

You start making the outline of things. 

A hole for a window, completely sealed off.

A bed.

A desk, with a plate and a glass.

But then, strewn on the floor, you start making out another shape. 

It looked... human. You think it is.

They stir, and there's the distinct clanking of chains.

They rise, slowly, and painfully. As if the smallest movement required the greatest effort. The chained person turns and faces you.

And in the glint of the light, you can see a pair of eyes and a face covered in messy gobs of hair.

Those eyes look in your direction.

They glower with hate.

"SEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRR!!!"

(Higurashi style Mion jumpscare)

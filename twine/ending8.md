# Reversal Radical Bayer, Sessler Wins

The Lieutenant crosses his hand and grits his sickly yellow teeth. He glares at the Sergeant and you in turns. The Sergeant responds, staring him down with a scowl reserved for when you smell rotten fish. "You are a real disgrace to this company, Oskar. Do you know that?"

"Spare me these speeches, Bayer. And, so long as you are speaking to me at least have the courtesy of referring to me by my rank."

"Why?"

"Excuse me?"

"Yes Oskar, why? Why would I show any kind of professional courtesy to you?"

"You may outrank me, you limp-dicked cunt, but you will respect my authori-"

"Your authority? Your authority?" He scoffs before breaking into a soft giggle.

"Let me tell you exactly what's going to happen to your authority, Oskar Sessler. It will be stripped away, and you will be taken to task over your behavior and your use of the Ministry to carry out your personal vendetta, that I can promise you."

"I'm warning you!"

"Of what?! You'll yell at me some more, I presume? The Agent has proven that Miss Leitzka is guilty beyond reproach of every crime that we suspected of Albert Hassel. Nothing about this investigation was normal."

"If you question intel one more time I will report you for sabotage myself! That woman is mine!"

"Yours?! That's it, you snake. You will go in-"

"I dare you to do anything to me, you traitor scum!"

"I will be heard, you bald bastard! I'm relieved I was here to stop you. I'm even more relieved that the Agent co-operated at his own risk!"

Hearing this, the Lieutenant freezes, his mouth agape in the middle of another invective. 

"We should be handing this over to Division IX, but quite frankly I would be surprised if the review took more than thirty minutes. This woman will be executed. Anything less would be a surprise." 

Lieutenant Sessler turns to you like a cobra eyeing its prey and starts yelling. "You! You! You will regret crossing me, you traitor!" He gets up and lunges at you. It's so quick you barely have any time to react.

"Stand down, Lieutenant!" Bayer hollers as he goes after Sessler. Before the Lieutenant has a chance to do anything, Sergeant Sessler grabs his arms behind his back and holds them down. "You will stand down, Lieutenant, this instant!" Bayer yells as he struggles to subdue Sessler.

"Let me go you bastard!" The Lieutenant screeches. "Let me go! Let! Me! Go!" He turns to you to proffer more threats. "I will kill you, you backstabbing bastard! Even if this son of a bitch puts me down I will find you! And then I will kill you! You will not escape me, even if I'm dead! You hear me?!"

"Guards! Guards! Help me restrain this man!" Sergeant Bayer cries out, hoping his voice will reach out from the interrogation room and into the halls. "Agent! For the love of God, help me!" He commands as he turns to face you, his face completely red as he strains to contain Sessler.

[Help him]

You get closer to at least come in contact with Sessler to pin him down. "Perfect!" Sessler snarls, as you see out of the corner of your eye Bayer's arms separating from the Lieutenant's body.

[Stand still]

You look at Sessler as he spits fire out of his eyes, daring you to obey Bayer. "Agent! Please!" The Sergeant shouts as you see his hands slipping and losing his grip on Sessler's clothes. 

Lieutenant Sessler manages to regain control of his left arm, and reaches into his breast pocket. You barely have any time to react as he breaks away from Bayer's grip. "Lietuenant, no!" The Sergeant cries. In less than a second, his face is millimeters away from yours and you feel something pierce you on your side. 

"AARGH!" Sessler roars triumpthantly.

Immediately, you feel as if something had lit your insides on fire. 

In and out.

In and out.

In and... no, it's in there. 

"NOOO!!" Sergeant Bayer wails.

The world swirls as the shock knocks you on the ground.

You'd expect to feel pain, but right now there's nothing. You look down and yes, on your side there's something there that there shouldn't be: A black cylinder embedded on you.

This fire inside you. It needs to stop.

You can hear the two men fighting, but right now that really doesn't matter.

All that matters is to get that burning sensation off your body.

So, you reach in and pull out the cylinder. 

You feel some relief, and you hold it in your hands. It's Sessler pen. Well, not really a pen. A knife concealed to look like a pen.

The Lieutenant had been carrying a hidden knife in his chest. 

And on that blade you could see a dark red liquid dripping from it.

You touch it. Then you touch where the cylinder just was.

More of that dark red liquid.

Yes, that's your blood.

It just dawned on you that you just got stabbed by Lieutenant Sessler and against all training and logic, you just pulled the knife out of your wound.

You look back up to find both men in a standoff: Sergeant Bayer is pointing his gun at Lieutenant Sessler as he brandishes a metal chair to defend himself.

"Stand down Lieutenant, that's an order!" The Sargeant orders, his finger shaking as it hovers over the trigger.

"Do it, you coward! Shoot me! Let's see how good of a shot you really are!" Lieutenant Sessler shrieks as he swings the chair at the Sargeant.

"I'm warning you--" The Sergeant yells before he's interrupted.

[VARIANT 1]

"How in the hell did they promote you over me?! If this was a just world, you'd be cleaning my shoes for five cents a shine on the ground floor! You are a traitor and you always will be! Your whore mother was a traitor! Your bastard father was a traitor! They've made for great fertilizer for the plants for their sin of birthing you, you slug! Those stripes on your uniform don't belong to you! Give them to me! Give them to me! Give them to me!"

[VARIANT 2]

"That little minx is mine! I've waited and I've waited! I will not wait anymore! I will not be denied by you Bayer! Nobody denies me! Nobody! I will kill you, I will take your pea shooter, and I will find out where is that woman locked up! And when I do, I will fill her in every hole she has and when I'm done doing that I'll make more holes in her for me to fill! I will gouge her eyes out and relieve myself inside her! And you will not stop me!"

[VARIANT 3]

"I will not go into those cells you traitor scum! Not without a fight! I know what they do to you in those cells! No sunlight! No window! No air! They don't even let you go outside! They just give you a bucket and let it overflow with your piss and shit! They wait until you go mad and beg for death! I will not go there! Both of you will be swimming in your feces before I go in there! I swear! I will fuck your corpses first before I go in there! So help me God you will fall on your sword before me!"

[VARIANT END]

"GHAAAARGH!" With one more swing Sessler manages to catch the Sergeant off guard and manages to hit him in the arm holding the gun. He lets go of it and cries in pain. The gun is knocked on the ground somewhere out of sight.

Sessler grins and roars again, this time with glee. He charges at Bayer and swings the metal chair over his head.

The Sergeant yowls and cries as he puts his arms forward to shield his head from the blows. "GUARDS! GUARDS! GUARDS!" He screams while Lieutenant Sessler erupts in a strange mixture of laughter and screeches as he continues to swing the chair against his superior.

"GUARDS! GUARDS!"

-clunk- -clunk- -clunk-

You see him whack the prone man again and again, every time he's not screaming for the guards posted outside the Sergeant wails with more and more pain.

"GUARDS! PLEASE!"

-clunk- -clunk-

It dawns on you that the Lieutenant is absolutely serious in his threats against you and the Sergeant's life. And if you want to survive, you need to leave.

You stumble and strain to get up, but you manage to get up on your feet.

The door! There's the door.

With every ounce of strength in your body, you open it. The door clashes against the wall with a clatter and a thud. 

Help. Help! How to get help?

Yes, the phone box. There's got to be a phone box on the hallway. That should get you someone. They're blue.

In the distance you think you see one. Yes that's great.

Dragging your feet across the floor feels like an eternity and a half, but you shuffle yourself across the hallway towards the box.

Closer.

Closer.

Just a little bit closer.

Closer.

C'mon, you can reach it.

Yes! It's almost there!

But then you realize something.

Something's missing. 

It's the sounds of the metal chair crashing against Sergeant Bayer's body. They've stopped.

"GOT YOU NOW BROWNIE!" You hear the screech from behind.

You do not have the time to react before you feel the full heft of a metal thing connecting with your head and your back.

You can't help but stumble and fall.

You roll over and look and who it is, but Lieutenant Oskar Sessler wielding a metal chair covered in blood.

"GREAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!" He cackles madly as he takes a swing at you.

You put up your hands to brace for the impact. And sure enough, the metal is no match against your bones. Pain undescribable shoots from your arms to your brain. 

The scream is involuntary.

[HELP!]

-CLUNK-

They're broken they're definitely broken. Your brain struggles to process this much pain.

[HELP!]

-CLUNK-

If they're not broken they're broken now. You have to fight back. Somehow.

[HELP ME PLEASE!]

-CLUNK-

Your arms are in tatters, you can't even feel your fingers right now.

[HELP ME SOMEBODY!]

-CLUNK-

All of the sudden, you can only see a hazy mass of aqueous red. But you can definitely make out Sessler continue to swing that metal thing at you.

[Help me]

-CLUNK-

The world swims in a dance of pain and relief. You can't really see anymore. Everything is so dark. But you can hear him continue to laugh and laugh and laugh.

-CLUNK-

You can't see anything anymore. And Sessler's mirth starts to drift away. You start to loose feeling everywhere. 

-CLUNK-

The world is dark. And every sound is diluted in a sea of pleasant waves crashing against the void.

-CLUNK-

-CLUNK-

-CLUNK-

Finally, darkness.

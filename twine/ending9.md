# Reversal Radical Sessler, Bayer wins

"Say Brownie, where's your favorite bar?" Lietuenant Sessler asks with a bit of a smirk on his face. 

"I've got a couple in mind," The Lieutenant says playfully. "I'm quite partial to The Blue Bird, there are some waitresses there that, well... They know me. They really know me. But I've gone a couple times already this month. Maybe we'll go to The Broken Clock. Yeah, think that's a good idea. Even if they close a bit early and their decoration is a bit garish, I'm sure we can empty some bottles of vodka."

Sergeant Bayer widened his eyes and slowly turns his head, as if the man had just said something truly unspeakable. Sessler pauses for a moment to look at Sergeant Bayer's reaction. He smirks. 

"C'mon Agent, surely there must be a place they know you by name. If you're an agent of the Ministry, and not be a drunkard is grounds for immediate suspicion! Fess up, Brownie. Tell us where you'd like to go." Lieutenant Sessler says, in his best attempts to establish rapport.

"Quite irrelevant to the current conversation, wouldn't you say Lieutenant?" Sergeant Bayer says, enunciating every syllable as he says it.

"Oh, I wouldn't say that, Sergeant. You should let loose sometimes." The Lieutenant quips as he fingers the papers on the dossier. "It's good for the soul. Heck, you're invited too. We've got something to celebrate, after all. The hostesses at the Clock have a way with guests you wouldn't believe. Specially Mielka, that woman is a dynamo. Hehehe."

The Sergeant is positively irate. His whole face turns red and he draws a deep breath as a wind up before his booming voice rings in your ears. "There will be no discussion of libations or fraternizing on company time, Lieutenant! You too, Agent! That is an order!"

Sessler is uncharacteristically unphased. "Oh please, would you lighten the fuck up, Sergeant? We got him! We got Albert Hassel dead to rights! I told you he was guilty, the intel never lies!" He says with a very sing-songy tone.

"You mean to say that you and your subordinate have deliberately steered the investigation for a conclusion that you already decided." The Sergeant snaps as he turns towards you with an accusatory finger.

"Look at all this evidence!" The Lieutenant says, waving the dossier around like a flag. "We played your game, we went the distance, we reported on the relevant findings. What else could we possibly do to convince you? Do we need to have some guy form Division IX too? Or maybe you want the entire department to come down and kiss your balls?" He says with some glee.

That last sentence was enough to zip up Bayer's mouth. "Exactly how did you expect this was going turn out eh, Bayer?" He says in between chortles. "That you were going to last as some avenger in the night for a pathetic little man? That we were going to entertain anything other than what the intel we had on Sessler? Frankly, it's like I'm explaining basic arithmetic to a child." 

That last one made this man, the stink of day-old cigarettes made into a human being, break into a fit of laughter. Bayer doesn't even blink as he continues to stare Sessler down.

"We have always done it like this, Bayer. Plain, and simple." The Lieutenant continues. "It's not going to change. We find them. We book them. We catch them. We throw them in a little cell. Sometimes I suck some to get what I want, and sometimes others want I got so they suck me. Surely you must know that much, Bayer? Say, how many people have you serviced to get to way you are? You must have done something like that, right? How many? Ten, fifteen, a hundred? All that work, and this is where it gets you."

Sessler turns to you with a raspy chuckle. "You know, don't even bother to answer that. The real boots on the ground have better things to do than to argue with you. Now c'mon, Brownie. Th'night is young, let's go get something to drink. If you can't come up with one place, let's just agree to go to The Bird."

"A game." Sergeant Sessler growls.

"Say what?" The Lieutenant asks as he gets up and motions you towards the door.

"This investigation? That's what it is to you. A game?" Sessler responds, this time with very tangibly contained anger.

"Not really, but it's going to be a really fun game once I'm done with you, Bayer." Sessler responds, dropping his buddy-buddy act and returning to his taunting, venomous cadence. "We will be submitting this for expedited processing, along with a very nice slip of paper that describes how you got in my way in every turn."

The Sergeant tightens his fists so strongly you swear you can see the capillaries in his knuckles. "You are accusing me of treason, Lieutenant Oskar Sessler. Tread lightly."

Sessler scoffs. He's having too much fun. "How about we talk about your have a penchant for sabotaging an operations critical to the safety of the country, hm? How about distracting the flow of a perfectly nominal Ministry investigation, directing it into a wild goose chase? And what about the brave Lieutenant and his subordinate, safeguarding the sate by curbing these terrible tendencies"

The Lieutenant gets down and puts his face right up on Bayer's. They're so close they could kiss.

"How despite the best efforts of the state, the bastard son of bastard traitors in the end cannot help his own damned nature." Sessler says with a murmur just loud enough for you to hear as well. "I hope it was worth it, Bertholt Bayer. I suggest you enjoy your last days as a free man, and get a drink."

The metal chair crashes as it tumbles to the ground. Lieutenant Sessler recoils as the Sergeant stands tall, his eyes almost sparking flames. "I will not have you destroying my name any further, you sniveling worm!" He roars.

In one sweeping move, Sergeant Bayer unholsters his pistol, cuts the cartridge, and trains it directly at Sessler's forehead. You jump, and motion towards the door by pure reflex. Lieutenant Sessler is surprised and frozen in place, all that bravado zapped away in a second. He's transfixed on the firearm pointing at him. "Right here, in my index finger, I have enough power to stop men like you, Sessler."

The tension in the room could smother a sperm whale. Lieutenant Sessler switch rapidly between looking at the nose-end of Sergeant Bayer's Makarov and back at his face. His gun, then back at him. His gun, then back at him. Seconds elongated into decades.

Slowly, the Lieutenant relaxed his posture and assumed a more submissive demeanor without taking his eyes off the weapon.

[VARIANT 1]

The Sergeant relaxed his grip on the gun, and lowered his trigger finger back to the grip. "You have rebuffed protocols, guidelines, rulebooks, and laws at every turn. It surprises me you have lasted in this organization for any period of time that's not half a day." He says, barely able to contain his anger.

And he won't for much longer.

"You are the reason I have a job. To find and convict the greedy and the corrupt. This country is too good, too pure, too just for the likes of you. Hail the Republic! Hail the Worker! Hail! Hail! The Motherland will be glad I rid her of this pest!" He shouts with an alarmingly increasing incoherence. His face contorts and warps into painful expressions, as if his features were trying to break free from the flesh.

[VARIANT 2]

The Sergeant relaxed his grip on the gun, and lowered his trigger finger back to the grip. "If you think your position in this organization is secure, Sessler, let me disabuse of that notion immediately. They know everything. The cheating, the crummy detective work, the stealing, the women. Everything." He says, taunting Lieutenant Bayer who can't decide whether or not he's scared or irate.

"The only reason why you're not behind bars right now is that the Motherland deserves to know of everything the blight on her body does! Let me tell you, you're a not a pest. You're a gangrene, Oskar Sessler. You and your lapdog are wounds on our Mother's body and as I live and breathe I will save Mother! I will cauterize the affliction and banish it!" He shouts with an alarmingly increasing incoherence. His face contorts and warps into painful expressions, as if his features were trying to break free from the flesh.

[VARIANT 3]

The Sergeant relaxed his grip on the gun, and lowered his trigger finger back to the grip. "The day I was rescued from those traitorous maggots was the day I was reborn, Oskar Sessler/ What greater joy is there than to serve this wonderful land and make sure she's safe? The Motherland remade me into her perfect soldier."

He pauses to gather himself as adjusts his pistol grip. "You should be remade too, Sessler." Bayer says, cracking a wide smile.

"They take away all your imperfections. All the things that distract you. They reshaped me, gave me a purpose. I gave it up, all for her! A life, a family, my children never to be! A paltry sacrifice, I promise! What kind of son would betray his Mother!?" He shouts with an alarmingly increasing incoherence. His face contorts and warps into painful expressions, as if his features were trying to break free from the flesh.

[END VARIANT]

"DO IT!" The Lieutenant roars. "I DARE YOU TO SHOOT ME, YOU BASTARD PENCIL PUSH-"

And that's when it all goes to hell.

-BANG-

There's pain. Indescribable pain as every single cell in your ears dies in a high pitched agony. Your head starts spinning and you can't help but to crumple and fall to the floor like wet towels.

And on the floor there's the Lieutenant.

At least you think it's the Lieutenant, it's a body wearing his uniform. But his head is all mangled.

Lots of blood, bits and bobs of pink, exploded, everywhere.

Blood oozing out of Sessler, he's on the ground.

Your ears, they keep ringing.

It dawns on you: Sergeant Bayer just shot Lieutenant Sessler.

You turn to look at the perpetrator, and you can't still hear a thing but you see him convulse where he stands, his entire body in a spasmodic fit. You can't really tell if he's laughing or crying.

He just shot his coworker, your boss. He's not all that there.

Then something primeval, something from the depths of your mind becomes like a siren going off in your mind.

You're probably next.

Finally your legs respond to your pleas and you get up from the floor.

The door! The door.

You struggle to open it. Your eyes are still ringing, but you see the Sergeant reading his pistol and aiming at the ground. You don't want to be here when the gun goes off.

Finally the metal door opens and you swing it wildly.

Help.

Help! How to get help?

Yes, the phone box. There's got to be a phone box on the hallway. That should get you the guards on the tower. You need to stop this madness now.

In the distance you think you see one. Yes that's great.

You also see a collection of vaguley human shapes coming towards you. Yeah! The guards. They must have heard the gun go off too. Of course, they'd hear that.

Your ears are coming back to you, but everything is muffled.

-BANG-

Oh, Bayer is not done. He's not done. If the Lieutenant wasn't dead, he is now.

You run towards the guards, and yell for help.

[HELP ME!]

[MY BOSS GOT SHOT!]

[DETAIN BERTHOLT BAYER!]

You see them run towards you. And you do your best to meet them. They have to have some firepower, you're sure of it. Before you're next.(run a script to play a gunshot and stop printing the sentence)

## Day 1

### Previous to questioning

As you prepare your dossier for the day's activities, you receive a phone call from the internal Ministry network. The voice on the other end is monotone, almost sepulchral:

"Agent Designation: Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-One-Three. You are required to present yourself at once to Central for dossier review following every day of operation while on assignment. Authorization. Delta-Sierra-Charlie-Hotel. Review of dossier will be conducted by Operations managers. Confirm receipt."

You confirm. Everything about this operation is strange. The timing of the operation, the rushed nature of your briefing, the fact that so many resources were being spent on these two people. Two persons that you had never even heard of being spoken about at any level within the Ministry. Even when everyone is subject to some form of vigilance, a line worker at a factory and his paramour are usually not subject to this much scrutiny. \n\n Even so, an order is an order.

A car ride and the standard security checks later, you are in an interrogation room that is usually for crime suspects. 

You've been on the side of the metal table where both Lieutenant Sessler and Sergeant Bayer are looking from. 

You've also been on this side of the table as a part of counter-intelligence training. 

You've also been on their side of the table, an incarnation of the State fashioned into flesh and bone.

The position you're in does not allow you to feel completely at ease. At least there isn't a scent pad on the bottom of the chair. You're spared persecution from the noses of the canine unit, for now.

"Well then, Brownie." Lieutenant Sessler barks with discomfort. "We have Sergeant Bayer here to thank for a Delta-Sierra style interrogatory. Can't say I'm thrilled to be away from my Marta at this hour. But, as the good Sergeant says: One cannot have too much scrutiny."

"Lieutenant Sessler," Sergeant Bayer responds, with some annoyance. "Our time needs to be spent efficiently and conscientiously. Of course, we cannot allow our enemies to go astray. Diligence must be the norm or we're no different from those uncouth bastards on the West."

Sessler grimaces at that comment, though he does so with his eyes directly fixed upon you.

"Agent, you may proceed with the dossier review." Bayer commands.

### 1.x No evidence presented

Sessler and Bayer sit on a pregnant silence as you explain that, despite what the surveillance might suggest, there was no evidence of malfeasance or wrongdoing on the part of either Albert Hassel or Nadine Leitzka. They appeared to be a perfectly normal, perfectly fine couple.

"Agent, I'm sure that setting up an operation on such short notice is not something you may want to do every day," Bayer quizzes. "But, I find it hard to believe that there was a complete lack of evidence on either party under surveillance."

"Are you trying to play us for fools, Brownie? Is Leitzka a friend of yours? Is Hassel?" Sessler accuses, with some anger in his voice. "If so, you should have recused yourself before we even deigned to waste our time on you."

"Now, now, Lieutenant Sessler," Bayer interjects. "No such connections have been established for the Agent. I'm sure given his time in the Ministry he knows not to keep close association with private citizens should it compromise the Operation. Although..." He shuffles through some of the documents in your binder. /n/n "The Agent has, to my knowledge, presented no such recusal in writing. If there is a such a relationship, now would be a good time to disclose it." /n/n You feel Bayer's absent stare sit on you like an elephant on a cushion.

You respond there is no such relationship.

### 1.1 Two Hams

Sessler and Bayer hear your report on Hassel's apparent material wealth. Both men stay silent for a moment. They look at each other with a tinge of amusement.

"Really?" Bayer starts to question. "You presume to convict a man on owning one too many cold meats? Is that the standard we will be going off on the Ministry now?"

"Bayer, please." Sessler interjects. "Exactly how often can you afford to have a high-ticket item on your kitchen that disappears from the Intershop in a day,  hmm? Specially when, as the Agent has said, hams have not been in distribution for weeks?"

Bayer motions to answer immediately, but pauses for thought. Sessler continues, smugly. "It has certainly been a few months since I've eaten a ham. If anything, I'd like to stop Albert Hassel to ask where he got them."

"It's very simple, Sessler." Bayer says, with a bit of a laugh. "He froze them. He froze them! You want to detain people for using their freezers, Lieutenant? Honestly. I don't blame the Agent for thinking it's odd but there are simpler explanations that do not require government resources."

"This line of questioning is irrelevant, Agent. I move to expunge it from record and press on." Bayer continues. /n/n "Nonsense! There's a reasonable fear of contraband with foods that didn't come from the Intershop. Don't know how it works over the fence, Bayer, but that doesn't happen here!" Sessler says, huffing with discontent.

_Option 1_

[Argue for its inclusion in the record to agree with Sessler]

You argue that while Sergeant Bayer's suggestion is plausible, it doesn't account for the shortage of similar food stuffs in recent months. far beyond safe consumption of hams even when they're frozen. It would be easier to check for a thawed ham, but the couple made no mention of where they got it, and how, and of it's taste. Not enough information is available to disprove contraband.

Sessler reclines in his chair, a bit too triumphant to have won in an argument regarding ham. Bayer tuts and shakes his head, displeased.

(lambda leader +2 superleader -1)

_Option 2_

[Withdraw the evidence, to agree with Bayer.]

You lend credence to Bayer's objections and make a note to expunge the evidence from the surveillance record. Sessler is non-chalant about it, showing his displeasure with a pursed lip, his yellow ghoulish teeth peeking under his thin lip.

(no change)

### 1.2 Using the radio to drown out a conversation.

Sessler and Bayer listen to your report about Leitzka and Hassel having a conversation that seems to be deliberately drowned out with a radio broadcast.

After a pause, Sessler asks "What time did this broadcast happen?"

You answer that it was around 0900 hours.

"Oh so, they're guilty of listening to the morning news with Raquel Gant." Sessler spits back with incredulity. "I listen to that show, you know. Well by your logic, I should be led away to a cell in handcuffs right about now."

"I believe that there is a little more to this than just a loud radio." Bayer says. "The subject wasn't just listening to the radio as a matter of habit, and just happened to have a conversation while the radio was still on. I believe that they turned on the radio to talk. The contents of the broadcast itself are largely irrelevant. They were seeking noise to cover up their conversation. It's a pity that this is just the first day of surveillance."

"It's a pity we're not increasing surveillance on a potential subversive element, eh Bayer?" Sessler asks. "It's almost as if that's exactly what we are doing."

"You knew well what I mean Lieutenant, being obtuse gets us nowhere." Bayer barks at Sessler, with some annoyance. "We cannot establish a pattern unless we see a repeated incidence of behavior, but I do believe this should be entered into evidence."

"It's a coincidence, Sergeant Bayer." Sessler proclaims. "Nothin' more, nothin' less."

_Option 1_

[Argue for its inclusion in the record to agree with Bayer]

You argue that Sergeant Bayer's suggestion is plausible, and how it could be a start to establish a pattern of behavior. Small bits of additional observation may be the tells of a larger offense to prosecute under state law.

Bayer looks in Sessler's direction with an air of smugness, while Sessler rolls his eyes.

(lambda leader -1 superleader +2)

_Option 2_

[Withdraw the evidence, to agree with Sessler.]

You lend credence to Sessler's objections and make a note to expunge the evidence from the surveillance record. Sessler purses his lips, and moves on to the next part of the interrogation. Bayer just tuts.

(no change)

### 1.3 Two Sofas on the Lounge

Sessler and Bayer listen to you making a note of Hassel owning two sofas not being much in line with someone of his earned income and station. Evidence may suggest that he is receiving more money than is reported on official documentation.

"Agent, there are hundreds of explanations that fit this piece of evidence that are not attributable to malfeasance." Bayer chides.

"Not to mention that's there's already something in-file that explains this course of action: Hassel was, rather unfortunately, involved with a malicious element that has been taken care of. I think owning a piece of furniture that used to by someone else isn't against the law." Sessler agrees, a surprised look on his face. /n/n "Now, Agent, please tell us why we should even entertain to include this piece of evidence into the dossier." Bayer says, rapping his finger on the papers.

_Option 1_

[Previous association with a detained subject.]

You say that precisely owning belongings that are potentially from a previous association are more than enough to arise suspicion of subversive attitudes. The rational thing would have been to shun and disassociate for one's own benefit and the country's.

Sessler nods in agreement. Bayer shakes his head. "If the Lieutenant wants to continue with our previous pattern in leaping to conclusions, I cannot help but think this is a gross misuse of state resources." /n/n "What do you mean, Bayer?" Sessler asks, annoyed. /n/n Sergeant Bayer sighs and raises his hands. "Add it to the record if you want, Sessler. I will not be co-signing sloppy work." /n/n "Bayer, why am I not surprised that likes of you want to be lax on suspicious persons?" Sessler tuts as he straightens up the papers against the desk.

(lambda superleader -1)

[Insist on the money angle.]

You insist that owning multiple pieces of this kind of furniture was not something that Hassel could afford easily, let alone with his time as a worker in the electronics factory. Even if there were other, simpler explanations, they should not deter from the fact that this an eccentricity that needs to be on the record.

Bayer rests his hand on his face for a few seconds, processing the information. He reads the papers, mouthing the words written. "I think this may have some merit, Agent." He says after reading to himself. "Not the best piece of evidence we've had against a potentially subversive element, but worth following up should the prosecution deem it needed."

"Unbelievable," Sessler says, angrily. "This is kind of reasoning that is going to convince you? The subject's choice of home décor? Tthis will put an anti-citizen element behind bars, Sessler? Tell me, is this how they caught your daddy?" He says, his voice rising in volume on every word.

Sessler stares down Bayer, seeking a reaction. All the while, the Sergeant is still like a statue. You swear you can feel the heat come off of his face. After about thirty seconds, he clears up his throat and responds. "I was very clear with my assessment, Lieutenant." He leans on the last word of that sentence, hard. "I think it's worth pursuing, as well as any other behaviors that are not consistent. The Agent's right to point it out even if it's slim."

(lambda leader -1)

### 1.4 Dissatisfaction with the party

A very clearly stated dissatisfaction with the state of government and the Party, while in and of itself not an act of treason, is often the gateway to subversive attitudes and affiliations. /n/n You were about to explain this, when both the Lieutenant and the Sergeant interrupt you. "Agent." Sessler says. "No need to go on about that matter. It has to be on the record as a matter of form. We've always done that." /n/n "Of course," Bayer responds. "This is just protocol. However I do have to wonder what could have motivated this outburst."

"Could have simply been that we created the dissatisfaction?" Bayer inquires. "We have put him on the no-exit visa list -- part and parcel of procedure. He is subject to Ministry surveillance, after all. This might just be a man annoyed at something we did. Of course, it's something that he has no right to know. He had never been in our sphere of interest before, and had no reason to suspect otherwise. Some manner of outward manifestation of discomfort is justified."

"We didn't start surveillance on this man out of the blue, Sergeant." Sessler responds. "Thuogh this should ring bells for you from. Remind you of dear pop-pop, hmm Bayer?" He says mirthfully, savoring those last words. "This fits a pattern of behavior that precisely justifies surveillance. Intelligence has put him on a list for reasons of state security. If Division XXI has reason to suspect something through independent informants, then we should heed their call." /n/n Sessler waits for a response to his provocation. Sergeant Bayer simply glances at him and remains silent.

[Agree with Sessler]

Sessler grunts with an affirmative tone. "Right you are, Agent. Right you are."

(lambda leader +2)

[Agree with Bayer]

Bayer mumbles with a bit of a humorous tone. "In his position I would be upset too."

(Lambda superleader +2)

### 1.e Ending

Having heard everything you had to report, both men get up from their seats. You respond with a standing salute.

"The surveillance goes on Agent," Sessler hollers. "Don't forget, now. We are the Shield and the Sword and yadda yadda. I don't have to tell you the rest -- you're familiar with the alternative."

And with that, they leave. You are now completely alone.

## Day 2

### Previous to questioning

As you take off your heavy headphones and prepare the desk for your night shift surveillance partner, you receive a phone call from the internal Ministry network. The voice on the other end is the same monotone that had preceded the interrogation from yesterday.

"Agent Designation: Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-One-Three. You are required to present yourself at once to Central for dossier review following every day of operation while on assignment. Authorization. Delta-Sierra-Charlie-Hotel. Review of dossier will be conducted by Operations managers. Confirm receipt."

You respond affirmatively. Fifteen minutes later, in the same office, in the same building, with the same yellow light illuminating a balding crow and a stoic rock. These two men will continue to decide the merits of your investigation.

"Delta-Sierra interrogation, Day Number Two. I do hope that the evidence presented today'll be useful to establishing any and all culpability for Mister Hassel." Sessler says, chewing something before spitting it out in a nearby bin.

"Plausible culpability, Lieutenant Sessler." Bayer says with a stern tone. "Plausible culpability."

"Do tell, how many years have you been in service to the Ministry Sergeant Bayer?" Sessler responds, offended.

"Enough to have out ranked you, Lieutenant." Bayer says in his lowest tones, unmoved by Sessler's accusatory japes.

Sessler sniffs loudly. "Is that how it works in the Ministry nowadays? We make ranking members out of deserters and traitors? No wonder this organization has gone to hell in a hand basket." He asks himself. (TODO: Look for an equivalent German expression) He waits a bit too long for a reaction out of the man he keeps taunting, but Bayer remains silent. You would not be able to stand a chance should you ever meet him across a poker table.

### 2.x No evidence presented

Sessler and Bayer sit in silence as you explain that, despite what the surveillance might suggest, there was no evidence of any malfeasance on part of either Albert Hassel or Nadine Leitzka. They appeared to be a perfectly normal, perfectly fine couple.

"Agent, I'm sure that setting up an operation on such short notice is not something you may want to do every day," Bayer quizzes. "But, I find it hard to believe, even after two days of surveillance, that there was a complete lack of any evidence on either party."

"I find your lack of work to be disturbing at best. At worst, some would say it's closer to sabotage." Sessler added, growling like a dog.

### 2.1 Promotion

You report on a subject of the investigation, Albert Hassel, getting promoted to Engineer Team Lead at the State Electronic Fabricator Plant no. 3, supervised by one Gerhart Kleiner. /n/n Electronic Fabricator Plant no. 3 currently produces boards and chip sets for the state's Official Computer Manufacturer, providing support and tools to offices both domestic and abroad in allied countries. While not absolutely critical, the Fabricator Plant is an important sector of enterprise in the State, and its organizational structure is cleared and reviewed constantly by the Ministry itself.

"Well, there you go Bayer." Sessler says with a bit of a grin. "You've been asking over and over for a justification for this surveillance operation. I'd say this is it. If Division XX has a credible reason to further vet the newest member of Worker Management, I don't see why we wouldn't."

Bayer furrows his brow, puzzled. "I understand that motivation." He mutters. "It is not clear to me how we have structured mid-management in this area of industry, specially if it's something that..." He trails off in thought.

"Specially if what, Sergeant? Be more specific, please." Sessler responds through gritted teeth.

"Forgive me for the cardinal sin of asking a question, Lieutenant. I just have not seen this much scrutiny over a worker reassignment that, frankly, sounds like a fait accompli. From the way the conversation has been recorded and presented to us, Mister Hassel's promotion is something that has already gone through the proper channels." Bayer says, scratching his chin still in a pensive mood.

"Division XX has fed us poor intelligence, Sergeant Bayer? If so, that is a very tall accusation that requires some ev-" Sessler accuses.

"And I have got a question for you, Lieutenant Sessler. Who is it in Division XX that you care so much about?" Bayer responds, with that particular tone people use when they want to re-establish their authority. "They are good Lieutenant, but they are not gods. They are not infallible. Your defensiveness is unreasonable, comrade. Unbecoming of a high official, as is your penchant for constantly forgetting yourself and your rank."

"I could be a fucking private, peeling potatoes in the shittiest outpost of this Ministry, and I'd still be of greater use than-"  Lieutenant Sessler starts his taunt. The Sergeant turns to you and cuts him off. "At any rate, I atill think this is useful. Agent, we should look into this Gerhart Kleiner, and his relationship with Hassel. As well as who cleared the usual check on his promotion."

"I agree with the Sergeant on that matter, Agent. Even if I... disagree with his assessment." Sessler sighs, gritting his teeth on those last words.

"We have to decide on an angle," Bayer mutters, playing with the papers on the desk. Sessler as always sits back, his hands crossed. His beady eyes are looking directly at you.

[Argue to investigate the Division XX background check]

You say that a perfectly fine citizen, slated to be promoted within state business, must have had a record check done. These checks are done with a level of thoroughness that would have been all that was necessary to establish prosecutable offenses. The fact that this individual is now under dedicated surveillance is not protocol. /n/n Sergeant Bayer grunts in agreement and takes a note.

(lambda superleader +2)

[Argue to investigate Kleiner and the factory]

You say that the involvement of a factory supervisor adds an additional wrinkle to the surveillance operation. Such a position would allow a potential subversive element to sabotage larger state interests and industries. The question then follows if Kleiner is involved into the matters that Hassel is being suspected of, and as such has become a suspect himself. Out of an abundance of caution, he and the factory operations should be investigated /n/n Lieutenant Sessler smirks, and looks at Sergeant Bayer with some manner of contempt.

(lambda leader +2)

### 2.2 Lying about meeting production quotas (super leader -1 AND leader +1)

You relate to Lieutenant Sessler and Sergeant Bayer that, from the way Leitzka had spoken, there may have been some tampering of the production reports for The People's Electronics Fabricant. Namely, their production numbers. The expression "made like thieves" could apply to several different contexts, including in this case a probable cause to investigate Albert Hassel's and Gerhart Kleiner's involvement in day-to-day operation. It may be indicative of, at the very least, a deliberate change in policy that has not been approved by the Ministry of Labor, or any officially sanctioned policy by The Party.

You didn't even have time to draw an additional breath of stale air before Lieutenant Sessler slid his chair backwards, stood up and started to pack up his belongings, motioning to leave. Sergeant Bayer looks at him dumbfounded, his arms crossed, as if the Lieutenant had thrown up on the table at a wedding. You didn't even know yourself if you were to stand up, or sit, since both officers gave you completely different queues about what to do next.

"May I ask why are you getting up, Lieutenant?" Sergeant Bayer asks with an inquisitional tone of voice and a sting of authority, a mother catching her child in-flagranti scribbling on the walls. /n/n Lieutenant Sessler looks at you, then at Sergeant Bayer, then at you, then at the Sergeant again. You can't tell if this is some kind of act or if he's genuinely confused. "You-you-you're not leaving Bayer?" he asks. /n/n "No I'm not, Lieutenant." Sergeant Bayer responds dryly, leaning on the last word and making sure he enunciated every syllable. "And neither are you, we have not discussed this piece of evidence at any length."

"I'm sorry, what's there to discuss?" Sessler spat at Bayer as he sat again. "It should be an open and shut case! Are you blind, Bayer?! We have something that is in flagrant violation of state law!"

"Well, I don't know about that." Bayer opines. "'Making like thieves' she says? I would pause and take care to know what she means."

Sessler scoffs at what is, in his mind, a questioning of the abundantly obvious. "Wha-they have stolen from the State, Sergeant Bayer! They have stolen from you, from me, from u-"

"Is that so? On that comment alone you plan to end this investigation?" Bayer interrupts. "That must mean you also plan to arrest Gerhart Kleiner, I presume? How about the rest of the plant? How about we go after every single person working at that plant, until the industrial capacity of the State grinds to screeching halt on the off-hand comments of this woman? Will that satisfy you, Sessler?"

"You'd love to see that wouldn't you-" Sessler starts muttering before interrupting himself, and raises his voice in a growl. "Wouldn't it concern us to investigate every possible threat to the integrity of the state, Sergeant Bayer? It is my duty, and yours too."

Sergeant Bayer shakes his head, Sessler's taunting is taking its toll. "This is a preposterous conversation, " he says. "Agent, let's move onto further bui-"

"I think not." Lieutenant Sessler interjects. "Brownie, you will enter this into the record and you will make an official note to investigate Gerhart Kleiner and all of his associates for any possible wrong doing at the electronics factory." He then turns to Bayer, and looks at him straight in the eye. "I will not stand idly by, Bayer. Even if you think this is ridiculous. I thought someone in your position would be more worried about something like this."

["The note will reach you through telefax at the soonest available moment, Lieutenant." You respond.]

"Excuse me, Agent. Lieutenant." Bayer says, an aggressive humdrum in his voice that called attention to his rank. "You will know your places, or I will transfer you to the mailing room. This operation is under my purview and my jurisdiction. Gerhart Kleiner and the factory workers are not part of this surveillance and they will not be added to it."

He stares daggers into you. "Do I make myself clear, gentlemen?" You nod and Lieutenant Sessler smirks with his yellow teeth. You think he is trying to convey some sort of camaraderie. You nod at him too.

Sergeant Sessler clears his throat and continues. "And if you want to say anything, Lieutenant, I'd appreciate you'd have the courage to speak up instead of muttering like a spoiled child. Now if you do not mind, I'd like to continue the debrief."

(super leader -1 AND leader +2)

["I believe that would be your duty as the superior officer, sir. I am not qualified to make such determinations." You respond.]

"Well met Agent, and it is my duty to co-sign said determinations." Bayer adds with a bit of a triumphant tone to his voice. "And while I commend you for respecting the chain of command, I must admonish you for bringing circumstantial evidence to this investigation."

He continued to talk, keeping his sight on you but clearly addressing Lieutenant Sessler. "And I would be quite appreciative that my loyalty to the State be not called into question by the likes of you, Lieutenant. I will not have a gung-ho, crazed apparatus attacking its citizens without reason, and this starts within."

Lieutenant Sessler scoffs and grabs his sheaf of papers, looking to exit the conversation into the next item of the agenda.

(Nothing)

### 2.3 Owning Wealth of Nations (super leader +1 OR leader +1)

You report that in the preliminary sweep of Albert Hassel's apartment you found a book that was clearly of some relevance to Leitzka. Upon inspection, you discover that the book was entitled "Wealth of Nations", translated. The book had a dust jacket on to make it look like as if it was a cookbook, which was clearly an attempt to hide its contents. This was an attempt to hide the contents of the book, and as such highly suspicious of being an unauthorized publication.

Both Lieutenant Sessler and Sergeant Bayer nod in unison, Sessler chuckles a bit while Bayer rubs his chin stubble.

"Well, well," Sessler says in a playful tone. "This's worth being late for dinner."

"I will have to concurr. Someone is going to be charged with possession of state-prohibited literature." Bayer snorts. "When was that book banned, Lieutenant?"

"Since Yalta, for all I care." Sessler says, handwaving the question away as if it wasn't even worth uttering.

"Agent, do you have any indication of who owned that book?" Bayer asks you.

"Again with the silly questions, Sergeant. You're missing the point!" Sessler interjects, not allowing you to answer. "It clearly belongs to Hassel, and even if it doesn't we have a probable cause to arrest and prosecute."

"Well, Lieutenant, let's not get ahead of ourselves." Bayer responds in an almost professorial tone. "It is not enough."

"Not enough?" Sessler chides in disbelief. "Not enou-Do you do your job with mittens, Bayer, or are you a Sergeant of the Ministry of State Security?"

"Lieutenant, I must insist. Let's not get ahead of ourselves." Bayer says in the same professorial tone, leaning on every syllable to get his point across. "I am not disagreeing on the merits of the evidence itself."

Lieutenant Bayer leans back, his chair scraping the concrete floor and making that awful noise once again. "Then enlighten us, O Wise One! What manner of sage knowledge do you have from beyond the walls of this most fair yet secluded land!" He says with the same nasally mocking tone one would expect from a schoolyard fight.

Sergeant Bayer glares at Lieutenant Sessler for a few seconds before responding. "I find it hard to believe that literature that has been banned from this country since it's very founding simply appeared on the living room table of a citizen that, up until now, has not had prior record of unpatriotic activity."

"Does that truly matter, Bayer?" Sessler grunts with derision.

"Oh I don't know, is the Pope Catholic?" Sergeant Bayer responds with the same mocking tone as Sessler adopted. "Of course it matters. If it means maintaining the surveillance, we may learn much from the end of the line of a subversive chain of command. This information stream will remain unmolested, so long as they unaware that they are being watched. That book must have come from somewherem, and we must know who smuggled it in."

Lieutenant Sessler started chuckling. "Unbelievable" he whispers.

"Excuse me, Lieuten-" Sessler starts to admonish.

"You're unbelievable, Sergeant. We have a criminal here. Is that not enough for this unit anymore? Do you want to have this damned criminal corrupting the mind of another citizen of this Republic, with words you and I know are completely against the Party and everything we stand for? And you want it to let it slide?"

Sergeant Bayer adjusts his black necktie and grabs the first few papers from the surveillance dossier, clearing his throat. "Let us remind ourselves, Lieutenant Sessler, of the purpose of this mission." He says with tremendous condescension in his voice. "According to the documents here, this operation looked to establish culpability of being related or being a member of a subversive organization with designs to disrupt the security and harmony of the State, is that not? A suspicion you found to be credible, beyond my purview mind you, what brings us here every night?" /n/n Sessler stays silent, refusing to respond.

Bayer hounds him further. "Is it not, Lieutenant Sessler? A charge of group membership? Something this book may be evidence of but has yet to indicate any additional persons?" He inquires.

Sessler continues to stay silent, Bayer tuts and shakes his head in disgust.

"What we have here is an illegal book. There is merit in pursuing that investigative line through our current surveillance. It would concern us to know where Hassel got that book. They are a clear and present enemy." Sergeant Bayer says, in that sort of manner when you announce you're done discussing a topic.

Lieutenant Sessler disagrees. "Get him to an interrogation chamber now, and we'll know right away!"

Sergeant Bayer massages his temples, clearly annoyed. "Wrong! He does not benefit in any way from telling us anything we might think is the truth! And I would not like to go and spin on the word of a first-time offender if it can lead us to the true enemy."

"What you're suggesting is waiting." Lieutenant Sessler responds with disgust. "No problem gets solved by waiting. Are we even the Ministry of State Security at this point?! Ten years ago-"

"Ten years ago this Ministry replaced enforcement of the law with iron and blood! A policy that has wasted this organization's time and resources so we would be feared! Our Politburo has decided that we shall stop wasting our time bleeding the populace at large dry while the enemies of this nation escape between the cracks! Under my watch we will be sharpshooters, not disgusting western hillbillies! I have that mandate, Lieutenant Sessler! We both do!" Sessler shouts. As he finishes, silence falls in the room.

[You argue that in any other circumstance the detention of Albert Hassel would be immediate, given the delicate situation it would be advisable to allow him to think he's not being watched.]

Sessler nods in approval, tutting. "Much as it displeases me, I have to agree with Agent Brownie. Even worse, I agree with you, Sessler. I don't want these traitor rats to smell the poison before it kills them. Let us see them first."

(leader +2)

[You argue that given Hassel's history, he might be even an unwitting door to a subversive organization that has the potential of appearing on the surveillance during the coming days.]

Bayer grunts in approval. "It's quite nice to see some actual intelligence work suggested from an intelligence agent." He looks into your eyes, smiling a grin a devil would admire. "We will be there watching, and we might just arrest and jail the traitors and the scum who want to destroy us from the inside out."

(superleader +2)

### 2.4 Nadine Leitzka's Picture (super leader +1 AND leader -1)

You explain that the surveillance feed captured Nadine Leitzka crying over an object that was stored in the suitcase that she deliberately put away. It's safe to assume that the object that she cried over is this picture. It would be relevant to the investigation to know who are the people in the picture. You hand over the instant picture you took with the Pentacon 6 you had on hand at the time. A picture of a picture smacks of tautology, but given the time constraints it was the best way to document the evidence.

Sergeant Bayer looks at the dossier, then at the picture, then the dossier, then the picture again, puzzled.

Lieutenant Sessler crosses his arms and leans back, with a smug little smirk. "I had suspected that vermin Hassel had Miss Leitzka against her will. I'm no specialist in human behavior, but I would bet that crying over a family picture is proof that at the very least she is being kept away from people she cares about, right?"

Bayer continues to look over the dossier files with a furrowed brow. "Strange," he says. "Her profile does not contain any information about living or even deceased family members. There are no names, no addresses, just a picture of her likeness, and her identity card information. Nothing to support that picture is of her family, Lieutenant Sessler."

Sessler emitted a cackle that might pass for laugh with generous consideration. "Ha, next you'll be telling us she came out, fully formed and grown, from the ocean spray inside a clam! And she was clothed by nymphs and magical creatures, Sergeant!"

Sergeant Bayer glared daggers into Sessler's skull. "Always a comedian. Never a laugh, Lieutenant." He spits. "As is expected, you miss the point. I have seen shoddy intel work, but this..." He moves his hands around the dossier he was just riffling through as if it was rotting meat. "This is horrible, Lieutenant."

"Caring about the quality of our internal processes, Bayer? Quelle surprise." Lieutenant Sessler snidely quips.

"As a matter of fact, yes. Yes I do." Sergeant Bayer responds with an air of self-importance. "This woman of no name is part of an investigation by being associated to a citizen that up until a week ago had no previous record, and the lack of intel we have on her doesn't bother you? Does it not bother you even slightly, Lieutenant Sessler? I would say the biggest suspicion would be on this woman! Technically, I think we have to stop her the moment she crosses the door of that flat because we do not even have a regular police check on record of her. We don't even have an add-"

"What do you mean Sergeant? She clearly lives with Albert Hassel!" Sessler responds with and increased annoyance in his voice.

"You would think that, of course, but her address on file is not the one listed for Hassel. I don't think she even lives in that location, and I am starting to doubt it even exists... Lieutenant, you are being quite flippant, even as this gross error is in your hands." Sergeant Bayer says, with an incensed demeanor.

"Oh please, Bayer, the last person I want to hear that from is you." Lieutenant Sessler defends himself.

"Answer me, Sessler. Why is there so little information on this woman? So little that we do not even know who the people on her picture even are? If not you, who must we blame for this much incompetence?" Sergeant Bayer accuses, raising the volume of his voice with every question.

"That's immaterial, and not a part of protocol, Sergeant Bayer." Sessler responds with gritted teeth. "I refuse to be responsible for work I did not supervise."

Sergeant Bayer purses his lips and takes a small notepad from his breast pocket to jot down something. "At this point one has to wonder, Lieutenant Sessler, what ARE you responsible for?" He mutters, making no effort to hide his words. Sessler squeezes the papers he holds in his fists, crinkling loudly.

He finishes his notes and addresses you directly. "So, Agent. What do we do now about this picture?"

[You decide that tenuous evidence is simply not worth keeping considering the preponderant lack of information.]

Sergeant Bayer lets out a heavy sigh. "You're right, Agent. We know too little, and this picture is largely meaningless without that information." He turns to Lieutenant Sessler and asks. "Have we got any further disagreements, Lieutenant?" With Sessler's silence, the Sergeants slides the picture of a picture across the desk back to you for safekeeping. 

[Investigate internal intelligence to ascertain why the profile on Nadine Leitzka is lacking in detail.]

"Normally, I'd be against keeping thinly substantiated evidence in an investigation. But, I will have to agree with you, Agent. We have a problem in internal intelligence, or it might be on records, or somewhere else. Either way, this has to be examined." Sergeant Bayer said, nodding. /n/n "And I guess you'll get your hands dirty figuring out why, Bayer." Lieutenant Sessler snidely remarks. /n/n Sergeant Bayer looks at his counterpart dead in the eye and pauses on every syllable. "Even if I have to dive into a pile of trash myself."

(super leader +2 AND leader -1)

### 2.5 Hastily scribbled map (super leader -1 AND leader +1)

You explain that the surveillance feed captured Nadine Leitzka hurriedly putting away a suitcase you opened to investigate. It's safe to assume that the she seeks to hide the objects in it. It would be relevant to the investigation where, if anywhere, the map depicts. [[(Do not display if 2.4 was presented) You hand over the instant picture you took with the Pentacon 6 you had on hand at the time. A picture of a picture smacks of tautology, but given the time constraints it was the best way to document the evidence.]]

Sergeant Bayer looks at the picture and squints at it. "My, my." He coos. "What do we have here? Our little songbird wants to fly. A traitor to land and country in the making." He hands over the picture to Lieutenant Sessler before continuing. "I wish we could make out what this is, I have never been good at recognizing bits and pieces of maps, as much as I hate to admit it. I'd rather source our dedicated cartographers, but given the time sensitivity of the operation we will have to improvise."

Sergeant Bayer motions towards you. "So, Agent. I hope you remember what you learned in covert cartography at the Academy. What does this thing depict, and is it relevant to our investigation?"

Lieutenant Sessler interjects. "Please Sergeant, allow me." He says, with a grin so wide and yellow it might be the crescent moon. "I think I recognize this curved, squiggled line here." He says, jabbing his finger on the photograph. "It should be the Anti-Fascist Protection Wall."

Sergeant Bayer is taken a bit aback. "Really, Lieutenant Sessler? It does not look like there is anything written on it to indicate that."

"Yes, yes, ever a sage of the abundantly obvious Bayer." Lieutenant Sessler responds with confidence, hand waving as he dismisses the Sergeant. "It doesn't have anything written on it, but it appears to be a guide to a spot near it where she might have agreed to meet someone." He glances at Bayer ever so slightly and puts on that terrible, yellow-toothed grin again. "I find it unlikely you wouldn't recognize it yourself, I'd hazard to say that's where you go down. Y'know, lay flowers every year for dear ol'mom and pop." /n/n Sessler relished his words, as their poison affected the Sergeant more and more. You could see it, the left corner of his mouth twitched ever so slightly.

"I don't see why I should mourn traitors." Sessler responds uncomically, you can see his jaw muscles bulging and pulsating. "You sound confident in your assesment, Lieutenant. It will still go under the review of Division XV Cartography, but if you are correct we can advance the investigation by that much." He continues.

"Agent, I'd like your thoughts. Is this the Protection Wall?" Sergeant Bayer asks, addressing you.

[Agree with Lieutenant Sessler emphatically, it is the Protection Wall.]

"Well, Agent." Sergeant Bayer says with derision. "I guess we should replace our cartographers with you and Sessler, here. Since we are so adept at identifying squiggles and doodles to be maps. Isn't that charming?" /n/n "Can it, Bayer. You can't admit a point when it isn't yours. It's pathetic." Lieutenant Sessler spits with even more hostility.

(leader +1 super leader -1)

[Agree with Lieutenant Sessler but communicate your doubts about the accuracy of the reading.]

"Stop coaxing the poor man, Bayer." Lieutenant Sessler chides. "You will see that I am right." /n/n "We will see, Lieutenant Sessler, we will see." Sergeant Bayer responds with a bit airiness in his voice, looking for the next item in the agenda.

[Disagree with Lieutenant Sessler / You don't really want to do this (roll on a jumpscare and loop back to the question C:<)]

### 2.6 Mystery Package (super leader -1 AND leader +1)

You explain that there has been a package delivered to Albert Hassel's post box. Which would be normal in any other circumstance, but as a matter of standard surveillance, all deliveries are postponed until the subject is either cleared of any suspicion or processed in-house.

When Lieutenant Sessler hears this, he chuckles for a good ten seconds. He seems pleased with himself. "Well, well, well, Bayer. I'd say some explanation is in order. Oh, you? Yes, you Sergeant." He taunts, saying Bayer's title in a mocking tone. "We required authorization from you to begin the operation did we not? I believe we did... yes. So, care to explain why Ministry Policy Seven-One-Four-Q-A was not enforced? All suspects involved in a sur-"

To your surprise he does not respond to the provocation. Sergeant Bayer interrupts the Lieutenant and picks up where he left off, continuing to drone on the policy rule, almost as if reading it from an index card. "All suspects involved in a surveillance operation must not receive mail or packages that have not been examined, recorded, and otherwise noted to the investigative party." He then turns to the Lieutenant. "I fail to see the merits of quizzing me on standard ministry procedure."

"I don't think you do, Sergeant Bayer." Lieutenant Sessler continues to taunt. "That requisition to the mail room clearly didn't happen. We have a package that didn't appear on Ministry teletype. So, that would make the superior officer of this investigation responsible in a breach of protocol. In this case, it's you. You, Sergeant Berthold Bayer." He leans in closer to the Sergeant's face, clearly looking for trouble. "Now, tell me. Did that requisition actually happen or did the right hand have to wait a week for the left?"

Suddenly, Sergeant Bayer stands at attention. He towers over Lieutenant Sessler, by about twenty centimeters. He glares at Sessler like he was sure his stare alone could melt him to a puddle. He takes a while to open his mouth but when he does, it is a low tone growl that sits like a rock in your stomach. "I have had enough of your insults, Sessler. I followed standard procedure without fail. Always have. Always will. Even for this sham of an operation I have had the duty to oversee. And, if we are handing out accusations of failing to follow procedure like it was candy, I should remind you of your own failures too."

He snatches the increasingly unwieldy folio and shoves it into Sessler's chest. "The requisition is part of standard form Five-One-Eight-Zero-Eight, which I signed at the start of this investigation. You will find it in this dossier."

Sessler grabs the folio and throws it on the table, scattering some of its contents. "You expect me to believe that, Bayer? Or is that something you snuck in after the fact?" /n/n Bayer motions towards you. "The fact that you, the agent, and myself are in this room talking right now should be proof enough." /n/n Sessler stands his ground. "Really? How so?" /n/n Bayer pulls from his inner breast pocket a small brown book, you recognize it instantly as the Ministry of State Security Manual of Procedures and Directives. "Since we are quoting the good book here's one for you." He manages to open it in the exact page he needs to before reciting, "A Delta-Sigma-Charlie-Hotel interrogation requires expedited acceptance of form Five-One-Eight-Zero-Eight at a Sergeant level or better for high-interest cases and operations." He closes the book and crosses his arms. "Or maybe you simply cannot get enough of me and the agent, so you just do this every night for fun?"

Lieutenant Sessler produces his own copy of the Manual from his breast pocket and slams it on the table. "Passing the buck, are we Bayer? Perhaps you're not the sterling image of procedure you purport yourself to be after all. Frankly I expected as much of you, a busybody like yourself doesn't get such a cushy job above his seniors in the force."

"Lieutenant Sessler, I will not tolerate this! I will not be blamed for mistakes made by Division XIX! I will not stand by and be accused of such!" Sergeant Bayer shouts.

"Yes, shout you fool!" Lieutenant Sessler barks. "So, what will it be? Either it was you who didn't do their work, or do we let this go as a departmental error?"

[This was a break from procedure.]

"Agent! You shall refrain from accusing your commanding superior of malfeasance or so help me God I will have you in a cell without windows for five months for insubordination!" Sergeant Bayer snaps at you, while Lieutenant Sessler smirks at you. He likes this showboating a bit too much.

(super leader -1 AND leader +2)

[This was a departmental error.]

Sergeant Bayer tightens his fists and lets out a deep sigh. After a small silence he returns to his normal tone of voice. "We seem to need to investigate a failure to meet protocol within the department and meter out appropriate punishments for parties involved. Division XIX will have to respond to this, and I'm sure there's a rational explanation." Bayer looks at you and nods, acknowledging you. Lieutenant Sessler looks at you briefly and squints. He accuses you of being a coward without saying a word.

(nothing)

### 2.x Conclusion

Having heard everything you had to report, both men get up from their seats. You respond with a standing salute.

(super leader is less)

As they exit, Sergeant Bayer whispers in your ear. "Agent, allow me to remind you of your loyalty. It is not to your superior, it is not to me, it is to the Ministry and the State. And, as far as I can tell, you have your priorities misplaced. I suggest you reconsider yours if you want to have a long career. Do not forget that."

(leader is less)

Sergeant Bayer leaves the interrogation room, with Lieutenant Sessler behind him. As soon as the sergeant exits the room, Sessler closes the door and faces you, looking at you like a frog he is about to dissect. "If I didn't know any better," he growls. "I'd say you are deliberately attempting to go over me. And I happen to be your superior officer. We have our ways in this Ministry, Agent Brownie. If a random Otto off the street is a threat to national security, he is. If a shoplifter is simply a boy in an errand, he is. We do as we are told. I do, and so must you if you want to have a long career. Don't forget that."

(all same)

And with that, they leave. You are now completely alone.

## Day 3

### Previous to questioning

As you take off your heavy headphones and prepare the desk for your night shift surveillance partner, you receive a phone call from the internal Ministry network. The voice on the other end is the same monotone that had come before the interrogation from yesterday.

"Agent Designation: Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-One-Three. You are required to present yourself at once to Central for dossier review following every day of operation while on assignment. Authorization. Delta-Sierra-Charlie-Hotel. Review of dossier will be conducted by Operations managers. Confirm receipt."

You confirm, this time with a bit more venom in your words. 

Something inside you is wriggling, tossing, churning as the company car takes you to headquarters. You are reminded of the interrogation training you did back at the Academy, how the very first interrogatory you went through pushed you to the very edge of your sanity. You were forced to relieve yourself in your pants as you sat with your hands under your legs, an officer of the Ministry grilling you, mocking you, taunting you. 

He kept repeating the name of your mother and your father.

Over and over.

Over and over, until the letters in their names lost their meaning.

Over and over, until their faces were smudges on a canvas.

Of course, you knew that they knew everything. 

And again, of course, you knew that it was just an exercise. A way of breaking in  recruits. 

But then, as always, a voice echoes from the back of your mind daring to ask what you do not speak out loud:

"Was it necessary?"

"Was it right, what they did to you?"

"Was it right, what you were doing?"

Before you could continue to think unrestricted, a loud electronic buzzer chimes and screeching metal doors jolt you into the now, back again in the same room. 

Back again in front of Sessler, a nicotine stain made manifest. 

Back again in front of Bayer, a statue quoting the rules like holy scripture.

"Shall we start again? Agent? Lieutenant?" Sergeant Bayer says, breaking the ice and motioning towards you to deliver the most recent surveillance notes. Sessler didn't deign to respond with words. He just grunted his approval like he was sending away a waiter for getting his order wrong.

### 3.-- No evidence presented

You explain that, despite what the surveillance might suggest, and the repeated insistence to the contrary, there was no evidence of malfeasance nor wrongdoing on part of either Albert Hassel or Nadine Leitzka. Though they were quite argumentative, it simply didn't seem that these people presented a threat to the security of the State.

"Mark my words, Agent," Lieutenant Sessler says just above a whisper, "by the time this investigation ends I will see to it personally that you will be transferred to where the only way to tell time is a broken clock."

Sergeant Bayer does a double take, surprised by this determination. "I have to say Lieutenant, that's not what I would expec-"

"No, no. Sergeant you misunderstand me." Lieutenant Sessler interrupts, savoring his words as they come out of his mouth. "Allow me to give you the full view of what you are doing by sabotaging this operation. At nine-hundred hours Monday last week we discovered a suspicious package in the perimeter of Waldsiedlung. We investigate it, and we found a bomb. A dud, but, a bomb nonetheless."

Sergeant Bayer tries to intervene yet again. "Lieutenant, you are releasing information that the Agent has no clearance to hear!"

"Bayer, I am trying to salvage this operation and you just cannot wait to set a criminal free! At the very least you will see to it that I give the scumbag in front of us a good reason to keep his job and his life!" Lieutenant Sessler bellows. Sergeant Bayer tightens his fists and starts to redden in the face.

"A bomb was going to detonate in the innermost sanctum of our Party. It was going to kill people, and injure who knows how many. The bomb has the makings of United Left, the organization that Hassel _is_ a part of. So, I give you one last chance, Agent. You will shape up and demonstrate your usefulness to this organization, or you will be processed for treason. You have no other options." Lieutenant Sessler says, looking to meet your gaze on every random eye movement you make.

Sergeant Bayer takes a deep breath and relaxes his fists. "A -- frankly gross -- lapse in classified information aside, you are required to report what you see Agent. If you cannot find anything truly worthy of writing down, then your continued involvement in this operation was a hindrance instead of an asset. We will see something tomorrow. You will report on the next proceedings, or I will step aside and allow Lieutenant Sessler to make good on his threats. He is your immediate superior officer, after all. Is that clear?"

You nod in agreement.

### 3.1 Mystery Package is for Nadine (super leader +2 and leader +2)

You explain that the mystery package that was picked up by Hassel, the same package that got past Division XIX, was addressed to Nadine Leitzka. This arises further suspicion as, by Hassel's own admission, Leitzka had not officially notified any government body about her current living arrangement despite cohabitating with Hassel for a period of time. This period of time was far longer than any leeway given to a long-form visit to a friend. At the very least, it meant Leitzka was guilty of failing to report to her local constabulary to update her mailing records.

"So, it would appear that we may have a much more interesting situation with Miss Leitzka than it was initially appraised." Lieutenant Sessler said, rubbing his chin after a brief moment of silence.

"I concur," Sergeant Bayer responds, nodding. "Let's put aside how exactly how did Leitzka receive that package without our knowledge. As the Agent said, the lack of a formal change of address from her is a lot more interesting. As far as we know, Division XIX had no way of knowing to stop the packages going to that domicile from Hassel addressed to her."

"What do you mean Bayer?" Lieutenant Sessler asks with some impatience.

"Assuming that Division XIX has done their duty in a timely-" Sergeant Bayer begins.

"You are assuming too much, Sergeant. Next you'll tell me that the package magicked itself into the mailbox!" Lieutenant Sessler raises his voice a bit more.

"Lieutenant, let me finish." Sergeant Bayer turns to Lieutenant Sessler and knocks the table with his fist gently, but just so that it would still make a sharp noise. "Assuming that they have done their jobs correctly, which I believe they did, that package was not handled by them but by an unknown third party."

"I was joking you know, Sergeant, when I said that. I can't believe this. We have a surveillance detail in that building, in case you haven't noticed!" Lieutenant Sessler shouts as he waves the dossier papers around. "Are you suggesting that what we're doing is insufficient? Should we open a division in the ministry for wild speculations? Call it  Gobbledygook Galivanting, maybe? We look for the simplest explanations, Bayer. Simple. Explanations." /n/n He continues to gesticulate in the air. "Is it really too far-fetched to expect our own systems to be infallible to let through one package, even if placed under a gag order? Have you known of any entity within this Ministry to be completely without fault?"

"We cannot start questioning over-" Again, Sergeant Bayer starts adopting that professorial tone as he was giving a lecture to you and the Lieutenant.

But, Sessler is one of those rowdy children who won't sit still. "Have you?" He insists. "Or are you the one and only Otto out of all the deserters and their spawn who managed to never make a mistake?"

It's evident that the Sergeant's patience is being tested. He clenches his fists as he responds. "You know I am compelled by the Party to say yes." He's heavy handed in his words, laying in on the sarcasm, his anger clearly bubbling.

"There it is then, clear as day." The Lieutenant said, triumphant and arrogant. He clearly loved taunting Bayer. "This a simple mistake by a Division having to screen the mail for an entire country, our country. That the package requires investigation, I have no doubt."

"Neither do I." Sergeant Bayer murmurs.

"But, proper framing is required, after all." Lieutenant Sessler says as he jots it down. "We might be arguing about something not that important."

(If 2.6 was presented)

(You were astonished to see what had just happened: Not only that those two were in complete agreement, but that Lieutenant Sessler could spin on a pinhead at a moment's notice. It was almost magical. You were looking for such a reaction in Sergeant Bayer's face, but none such luck.)

[Argue for a clerical mistake in Division XIX]

Lieutenant Sessler jots notes down. "Well," he says. "I think it would be best to investigate the matter internally, we can't afford rookie mistakes on the operations of this Ministry."

 Sergeant Bayer crosses his hands, and looks off to the side. "And, I will thank you if you do not question my loyalty to this government Lieutenant. I'm well aware of my treasonous parents." He says. Sessler looks in the Sergeant's direction, and you find him smiling from ear to ear. He does his best to stifle a chortle, but a small bit of it escapes his lips.

(Leader +2)

[Argue for a third party dropping packages in Hassel's mailbox]

(Superleader + 2)

"It's a shame that we cannot afford to record much on tape, much less for video feeds." Sergeant Bayer says, gesticulating in the air as he did. "We would be able to see who exactly made this drop and they be identified. For now, we'll have to shelve that part of the story, and make a note to investigate it in its own time."

Lieutenant Sessler tuts at this suggestion. "Might I suggest a trip to the psychiatrist, since making things up and having hunches now seems to be part of your standard surveillance repertoire, Bayer." /n/n "If you had more imagination you'd be my superior three times over, Sessler." Bayer responds with an appreciable amount of disdain. "There are more factors at play Lieutenant, you'd do best to identify them in a matter of national security instead of questioning my loyalty. I will not respond for my treasonous parents, either." He responded, with a bit of arrogance specially on that last sentence.

### 3.2 Missed Phone Call (super leader -1 or leader -1)

You share that a phone call coming out of Hassel's flat was unfortunately left unrecorded because you were occupied with the local Party office to hold Albert Hassel off for an unspecified period of time.

Both of the men in front of you have a shocked looked on their faces. Sergeant Bayer scratches his forehead and shakes his head. Lieutenant Sessler raps his fingers on the metal table, mouthing to himself something you can't quite hear.

"Agent," the Lieutenant asks with a distinct annoyance, breaking the uneasy silence. "May I ask what exactly did you expect showing this to us? Honestly, I'd rather you'd never mentioned it at all."

"Belay that, Lieutenant," Sergeant Bayer says, motioning towards Sessler. "I commend your honesty, Agent. Believe me, I do. But that doesn't excuse your lapse in competence at this level of Ministry work."

Lieutenant Sessler lets go of a cackling laugh that resonates in your skull. If a tree could scream while it was being chopped, this would be the noise it makes. That laugh could send chills down the spine of the best covert agent. In between the gasps of laughter he ekes out his words. /n/n "Your temerity is astounding, Agent. Truly."

He composes himself before he points the finger at you and growls. "I should perhaps ask your mother if you grassed on your friends when you were little too."

Sergeant Bayer turns in disbelief at Sessler and shouts, scandalized. "I will have your silence and obedience, Lieutenant!" He then turns to you. "Please don't waste our time anymore, Agent. What is it that you want to do with this report?"

[You take the script piece of paper and you rip it to shreds.]

You see Sergeant Bayer's face turn and twist into an ugly visage. "What are you doing Agent?! That is state property you are destroying! It' s part of an ongoing investigation, and an official state document! I should give you a formal writ of reprimand!" He hollers, red in the face. Lieutenant Sessler just looks at him and smirks, then back at you and smirks again. It's like there was some kind of game, and he just won.

(Lambda super leader -1)

[You insist that it must remain on record, embarrassing as it is.]

Lieutenant Sessler purses his lips, and throws the papers he was manhandling on the table. "Suppose you want to file the wrapping paper of the sandwich you ate today too, lest it not be stricken from the record." He says, leaning heavily on his mocking tone of voice. Sergeant Bayer sneers at him, and motions to move onto the next thing of the agenda.

(Lambda leader -1)

### 3.3 Unfamiliar person to investigation was not in surveillance (super leader +2 and leader -1, no argument needed, passthrough)

You present evidence of a third party hitherto unknown and unrecorded on the dossier files, known only as Sonia. This person comes into Albert Hassel's flat, is known to Nadine Leitzka, and does so at a moment of high distress. For as little you know about Leitzka, a new person that the Ministry had no prior knowledge of is important to discuss.

Sergeant Bayer looks at Lieutenant Sessler with a puzzled look, as if he was trying to test his mettle in a staring contest. The Lieutenant doesn't seem to be pleased. You seem him shrug and make a crumpled grimace.

"Are you sure we're not surveilling the wrong person, Lieutenant?" Sergeant Bayer asks. "Because this Leitzka is like a box of unpleasant, unrecorded surprises."

Lieutenant Sessler makes some kind of a grimace at the Sergeant, showing his yellow teeth as if he were a growling dog. "I have to admit this "Sonia" character is quite interesting, wouldn't you agree, Sergeant Bayer?" He says, barely above a whisper.

"No, Lieutenant. You will answer my question." Sergeant Bayer says, firmly and with the slightest tinge of anger. "Is this "Sonia" somewhere in Leitzka's file that you simply elected not to share with the investigation?"

Lieutenant Sessler raises his voice, and looks at the ground as he speaks. "I wrote all into information I had on the citize-"

"I find that very hard to believe." Sergeant Bayer interjects, raising his voice just above Lieutenant Sessler. He ups the ante on his annoyance. "We are the Ministry of State Security. The Sword and Shield of the State."

"Oh you're going to basic quote party doctrine to me? Should I recite the national anthem as well since we're quizzing each other on basic education?" Lieutenant Sessler responds, letting out a nasty nasal tone as he did.

"You misunderstand me, Lieutenant Sessler." Sergeant Bayer says, raising his voice yet again to what you could call a low-volume shout. "This ministry by its very nature must have eyes and ears, everywhere. And it has. We know everything because for this Nation to survive the blasted enemy at our gates, and within this very city, we MUST know everything."

Sergeant Bayer takes a deep breath to continue his sermon. "And now... Now! Now I find out that we have a massive blind spot. A memory hole where all information goes to die, and its name is Nadine Leitzka. And to my endless luck and fortune, we happened to stumble upon her!" /n/n He chuckles before continuing. "It's quite convenient, almost as if written by a third-rate hack!"

Lieutenant Sessler shakes his head violently and smashes his fist on the metal table. "And your point is, Bayer!?" He snarls.

"Oh! Oh, my point Lieutenant?" Sergeant Bayer responds, mocking with the same nasally tone that the Lieutenant adopted. "Oh you are going to positively adore it! I don't think she is a blind spot at all. I think someone has protected this woman within our organization and using our resources to do so. I will start asking who and why, and I will start with you, Lieutenant Sessler!"

Lieutenant Sessler stands up, clenching his fists. His face reddens with anger. "Prove your accusations, you cock-sucking traitor-spawn, or so help me-"

Sergeant Bayer stands up from his chair too. He towers over you and Sessler, like an ancient monolith. "You'll do what, exactly?" He taunts. "Sabotage us further? I think you'll find it hard to do in a room with no windows and four walls closing in."

"Fuck you Bayer!" Lieutenant Sessler shouts, enraged, before turning towards you and directing his anger at you. "And fuck you too, you Brownie! If I'm eating shit for this, you will too, you pencil-necked pimple!"

"ENOUGH!" Sergeant Bayer roars. 

He does this so loudly, it forces you to sit up and pay attention. It shook up Sessler before he proceeded to enumerate the ways you had just screwed yourself over in the process of doing your job. "No, no, Sessler." He says in his professional, lecturing manner. "The Agent's duty is to report, which he has done gallantly. Yours, on the other hand, is to fall on your sword, chest-first, if our apparatus deems it necessary for it's continued survival. Any more expletives from you, any other one. Or mention of the traitors who I did not choose to be my parents, and I promise you I will take care of you and your wife personally."

Filled with anger, and no words to convey it, Lieutenant Sessler sits down and growls like a dog that just got punished. He looks at you, and seeks your eyes when you avert them, daring you to look back. Sergeant Bayer takes his seat, draws in a deep breath, and shuffles the papers in front of him. He motions to continue the examination and go no further on this subject.

(super leader +2 and leader -1, no argument needed, passthrough)

### 3.4 Evasive "Sonia" (super leader -1 and leader +2)

You discuss the conversations that this person, Sonia, had with Nadine Leitzka. The content of the conversation was cryptic, as was the way she carried herself. She spoke in code, and would probably not be noticed had it not for the surveillance apparatus that was watching the Hassel residence. If Leitzka was mysterious, she was doubly so. Sonia was probably an alias, and that was enough grounds for suspicion.

Sergeant Bayer looked at the case file and looked at it backwards and forwards, as if he was trying to get the last chocolate out of the box. "I am not quite comfortable with the idea that a person that is relevant to this investigation is not a character we could readily identify with the existing surveillance setup." He stops manhandling the notes and looks directly at you, inquisitively. "As I understand it, she was covered from head to toe, no? I think that is quite suspicious, to conduct oneself in that manner..."

Lieutenant Sessler shrugged, with his yellow grin. "Or maybe she is cold?" He quipped.

Sergeant Bayer furrowed his brow, he almost seemed offended by that insinuation. "She was cold? That is the best you could come up with, Lieutenant Sessler?"

Sessler scoffs, he's behaving like a teenage girl who is getting the business from her father. "Bayer, what was the temperature outside today? During the day."

Sergeant Bayer lets out a chuckle, but not a pleasant one. "Is this a trick question, Lieutenant?"

"C'mon Bayer, humor me. Take a guess." Lieutenant Sessler responds.

"I'd say... seven degrees? Maybe?" Sergeant Bayer responds with tremendous incredulity.

Lieutenant Sessler slaps the handles of his chair and motions towards the Sergeant with an uncanny amount of confidence. "There's your answer, Sergeant! It was seven degrees outside. She is cold, Bayer! It's the start of March, for the love of God. This woman is simply sensitive to cold and we are supposed to jump on her for dressing the part?" He cackles before continuing to admonish the Sergeant's paranoia. "I'd be dressed like that too if I expected to be out and about. I'd suggest you start worrying about relevant evidence."

Sergeant Bayer shakes his head, showing his teeth as he does. You can't really tell if he's smiling or gritting his teeth. "You know, that's quite rich coming from you. After all you are famous for your boundless patience and inexhaustible prudence. And, lest we forget, your pragmatism."

The sarcasm of Sergeant Bayer goes over like a lead balloon in a thunderstorm. Lieutenant Sessler crosses his arms and defies his superior. "Oh, is that so?" He responds with an accusatory snarl.

"Oh, absolutely." Sergeant Bayer responds, relishing the verbal fencing. "Only insofar if you consider a cudgel to the head a pragmatic solution, Lieutenant."

Lieutenant Sessler lets out a loud, raspy cackle that just might be the worst thing you have ever heard. It made nails on a chalkboard sound like Beethoven. "I'm more surprised you don't agree with me, Sergeant." He says in between wheezes.

The Sergeant scratches his chin, posing as if he was thinking intensely. The debate is starting to devolve into a childish spat, with all this snide commentary. "Well... let us start with the fact that she is an unknown person to our intelligence apparatus." He starts in his professorial tone. "That alone is grounds for suspicion and prime material for a formal departmental inquiry."

Lieutenant Sessler clicks his tongue. "Now who is misusing Ministry resources, eh?" He says. /n/n Sergeant Bayer inches closer to Sessler's face, seeking his gaze wherever it would be pointed at. "Right, if you don't pursue this the judgement to be doubted is not going to be mine but yours. I'd rather you not risk your career on dismissing a suspect because you think they're cold."

"I'm sorry," Lieutenant Sessler chuckles. "I don't kiss orphans." /n/n Sergeant Bayer is taken aback sits back in his chair. You have never seen this man caught off-guard and yet this remark broke his otherwise stoic demeanor.

[Say nothing and stare at Sessler]

You decide to stay silent and look at Sessler for guidance. The Lieutenant grabs the folio with the report about Sonia, folds it up, and stores it in his coat pocket. He gives you a complicit look and puts on his best smiling face. "Well if the Sergeant says so, then we'll do it! We'll pursue this lead and see if the Ministry has any materials." Sergeant Bayer nods, satisfied with this answer. Though, the unspoken reality between the three of you is quite different. Bayer looks at you with a certain degree of contempt.

(Super leader -1 and leader +2)

[Insist on keeping it on the record.]

You speak up, and slide the folio towards Bayer. A lead is a lead and we should follow all of them. Sergeant Bayer looks at the piece of paper, and pauses for a moment. "Is this the only copy there is of this piece of evidence, Agent?" You nod. "Well, that won't do for records and investigations." He says, folding it and giving it to Sessler, who up until now was looking you as if you were a small gazelle and he a big lion. "Lieutenant Sessler, you may assign another agent to the task of looking into this Sonia, in the mean time we'll have to do with the Agent's notes." The Lieutenant receives it, hesitant about what to do next. He then flashes a devilish grin, nods, and then puts it in his breast pocket.

(Nothing)

### 3.5 Description of "Sonia" (super leader +2 or leader +2)

You hand over a detailed likeness of this new person of interest, for now identified as "Sonia", to Lieutenant Sessler and Sergeant Bayer. They listen to you with interest, in their own individual way. As you get deeper into the description, you notice that the Lieutenant's eyes drift away and focus somewhere else and turns his face away from you. Sergeant Bayer, meanwhile, keeps his attention on you the entire time.

"Have you submitted this likeness to Division VIII for a preliminary citizen record sweep to see if we can find this individual?" The Sergeant asks. You have to say no, this meeting was of higher priority.

"Why is this a sketch? This Ministry has so many cameras in many different sizes and configurations, and you happened to be without one?" Lieutenant Sessler asks, snarling as he manhandled your sketch as if it was some kind of soiled napkin.

You finagle a bit to answer the question. Up until that point it had not occurred to you that there could have been cameras at the surveillance site that you could make use of at the field office. You scramble for words and half-remembered gibberish.

Sergeant Bayer turns to the scowling Lieutenant. "I am sure the Agent had a good reason to deliver a sketch instead of a picture, indeed I am quite pleased with the rendered likeness. It is better than to have nothing at all."

The Sergeant picks up the sketch and turns it around, squinting at it as if he dared it to blink. "It is actually quite well made, considering your constraints."

"I am actually a lot more concerned that you abandoned your post, Agent. You missed what could have bene precious evidence in the prosecution of the enemies of the state. Every second counts, and every millimeter of tape recorder costs this Ministry money. Did you hear anything on the tape playback that would be worth mentioning to this investigative body?" The Sergeant growls. You shake your head frantically. Nothing but pops and scratches. "Heh, I hear any more scratchy tapes and I'll have to report to the Party Bureau that cats are Public Enemy Number One." He guffaws.

The Lieutenant stands up in a huff, and walks over to your side of the desk to grab the sketch. "If you two have stopped horsing around on the job," he says. "Then it falls onto me to submit this piece of evidence to Division VIII for a preliminary likeness match against the citizen database." He then looks at you with eyes that could kill. "I'd hope that the time and resources of the boys up in the twentieth floor would not be wasted on Agent Brownie's artistic exploits. But, it seems that we will admit a bag of dog turds as long as we can twist it as evidence."

"Ah, Lieutenant." Sergeant Bayer says in much less friendly tone. "This is not your responsibility. Hand it over."

"What, Sergeant? It's all going to the same place. What does it matter if this Picasso on our payroll puts this scribble up for collection or his supervising officer?" Lieutenant Sessler says, motioning with his hands and waving the paper around.

"A chain of custody, Lieutenant, that is protected by law and enforceable with severe punishments." Sergeant Bayer snarls, pointing at you as he does. "Leave that piece of paper alone, and give it to the Agent."

Lieutenant Sessler is taken a back, a first for you to see him at a loss for words. He clutches to the sketch so hard it's creasing in.

"Look at what you're doing Sessler!" The Sergeant bellows, you could swear you could see fire sparking in his mouth. "You're damaging state property! Get a hold of yourself man, and hand it over before I have to write you up for an administrative punishment!" The Lieutenant looks like a dear in headlights. Sergeant Bayer grabs his wrist and pulls at it, forcing the paper out of his hands. "No!" He yells with a mixture of anger and fear. "What is this manner of insubordination Lieutenant Sessler?!" Sergeant Bayer shouts, more confused than upset.

"I am the commanding officer, goddamn you Bayer I'll take care of it!" The Lieutenant says angrily. But, not in his usual delight in cruelty demeanor. No, this was different. This was more akin to a child trying to negotiate himself away from mother's punishment. "Enough!" Sergeant Bayer snaps. This is enough to get the Lieutenant to stop gripping the sketch, now crinkled all over.

Sergeant Bayer undoes the folds, and stares at it briefly before pushing it in Lieutenant Sessler's face. "What is this Sessler? What is it that you want to hide?" He asks. Lieutenant Sessler is silent as a tomb, staring a thousand meters into the distance. "What is this Sessler, answer me?" Sergeant Bayer asks again, with an even sterner tone. "What is this Lieutenant?"

Nothing. Not a word.

The Sergeant is at a loss of words as he continues to stare at this schizophrenic character. Seconds of silence are elongated into eternity, as both men are challenging each other to break the silence.

Frustrated, Sergeant Bayer hands you over the piece of paper without saying a word.

[You slowly put the drawing back into the dossier.]

(Super leader)

You don't know what to make of this outburst. You don't know what you will do if it happens again. But you know that you must push the paper back in the growing sheaf of folios, notes, and typed papers to make this entire ordeal go away quickly.

[You decide to give the paper to Lieutenant Sessler]

(Set give_leader_sketch to TRUE)

(Leader)

You know that Lieutenant Sessler wants this piece of paper. You know that Sergeant Bayer will not tolerate any more random acts of insubordination. While he could take arms against Sessler, antagonizing this man would mean you would be finished in a day. You push the sketch back into the sheaf of papers as you stare straight into Sessler's eyes. He returns the stony gaze, and motions his eyes in a jerking motion, a universal signal among Agents to silently agree to meet after an event is over. You'd have to roll the dice on whether or not Bayer noticed this exchange.

### 3.6 Pleasantries with the neighbor (super leader +2 and leader -1 )

You explain that Albert Hassel had decided to talk to the neighbor before entering his own flat, something that he had not done previously. This conversation was unrecorded, given that there was no indication that he would have any sort of interest in his neighbors. This needs to be entered into the surveillance dossier as an interaction that could have adverse effects if the identity of the other person is not known.

"Do we have the list of tenants on file, Agent?" Sergeant Bayer asks. You produce the list of tenants in Hassel's building. The apartment number and description match citizen Laurie Weiss.

"She seemed to have a connection with Nadine Leitzka. I believe this would require at least a cursory inquiry on her character and information, but nothing more." Sergeant Bayer says, in that kind of tone that says that the conversation should move on.

The Lieutenant disagreed. "Oh, Bayer. Bayer. I don't think that is necessary."

Sergeant Bayer looks sideways at the Lieutenant. "You do the job well or you don't do it at all, Lieutenant Sessler." He says with a heavy sigh. "Agent, please order that inqui-."

"No, no." Lieutenant Sessler intervenes, gesticulating with his hands something fierce. "Agent, belay that order. I will determine what is relevant in this investigation. This has one target and one target alone and his name, lest you forget Sergeant, is Albert Hassel."

"And his associates, Lieutenant Sessler." The Sergeant responds, raising his voice. "Surely you cannot be so wet behind the ears you would think they were blameless."

"Sergeant, we must focus! The tenants are not relevant to this investigation!" Lieutenant Sessler shouts, slamming his finger on the dossier he held.

"Who are you and what did you do with Oskar Sessler?! Suddenly, the budget concerns you?!" Sergeant Bayer bellows. "You want to stick every man, woman, and child in prison so much as they glance in your direction! And,this nobody is the one individual where we must not be hasty!?"

"That woman is the wife of a government worker Bayer! I won't have rabble like yourself dirty the good name of loyal men and women!" Lieutenant Sessler responds. There's something in the tone of his voice that tells you that he doesn't believe the words coming out of his mouth. /n/n Sergeant Bayer is violently confused, making grunts and noises that try to go past the embryonic stage for words.

[Vocally support Sergeant Bayer]

You speak up, citing Ministry rulebooks and regulations that compel you to report and follow up with any unknown associates. Sergeant Bayer smiles triumphantly. "The Agent is quoting the book at you now, Lieutenant Sessler. I should caution you to be more diligent, lest you take his position and him yours." He says with a guffaw. Lieutenant Sessler responds, while looking directly in your eyes. You'd think he was trying to make your eyeballs boil with thought alone. "Why am I not surprised that Agent Brownie's career path was to become a petite bourgeois pencil-pusher?"

(super leader +2 and leader -1 )

[You say nothing]

You decide to stay quiet, and the pair of squabbling men to their own argument. It had been just about the ninth time you'd hear this argument between your two superiors. It was becoming old hat, quickly. You'd wonder if they would ever agree on anything. You wonder if they were enjoying fighting each other. You wonder if they continued these interrogations simply because they just wanted to spread misery around.

(nothing)

### Conclusion

The men get up from their seats and, as before, you respond with a standing salute. Though the gesture is becoming more and more empty by the minute. Some rotten job this is.

(If give_leader_sketch to TRUE)

You make sure you are the last one to leave the interrogation and you walk slower than both Sessler and Bayer, matching their pace but remaining behind. Basics of following a suspect. The highly strung up Sergeant Bayer doesn't notice and just plods on along to whatever task he was supposed to do before tending to the operation. Lieutenant Sessler slows down his pace and allows you to catch up. You produce the sketch from the dossier, folded in a neat little square. Lieutenant Sessler stops ever so softly, opening his hand. You walk past him and in a very brief slight of hand, you hand over the paper he wanted so badly.

You figure that if he wants this piece of paper this badly, he should have it. Not really your business if it ends up in the right places. They'll soon blame a clerical error on review of the evidence than considering the possibility of evidence tampering, It just didn't happen in this country. Unthinkable in the mind of a patriot.

(Else)

Before any of them can talk to you as they did yesterday, you bolt out of these with a brisk walk. You can feel them stare at you as you walk away from them as fast as your legs can take you without sprinting.

(End If)

Every evening you spend with these two it feels like something slides in between your skin and your flesh. Something that doesn't let you breathe or sweat, that dulls your senses. It feels like a shrink wrap pressing on your eyes, mouth, and ears. Not nearly enough to suffocate you, but getting to it slowly.

Every door on the hallways comprising the interrogation room block has these little rectangular windows with a fine mesh over them. They let the air in but they don't allow people to look from the outside in, nor the other way around. So, they're not truly windows.

They're vents.

They're little pinprick points that look like beady bug eyes on the walls. Everywhere, and anywhere.

## Day 4

### Previous to questioning

It doesn't take long for Hassel to act on his gut feelings and run out of his flat, looking for Leitzka. He screams atop of his lungs, with a mixture of anger and concern. "Nadine! Where are you?! Nadine, come back!" He yells in a high-pitched whine that sounds like the saddest car horn. You stand outside the building, pretending to wait for a car as you watch him run down the street.

For the first time you catch a good look of him using just your eyes and nothing else: He looks as if a potato had grown out legs and started to walk and talk. As he ran, he had this kind of side-to-side gait, balancing his fat stomach between two twiggy legs. There was always something that brought you this mirthful joy, being ignored by someone who you're intimately familiar against their will.

As if directed by an orchestra, the standard black lacquer ministry car arrives to pick up you up. In the distance you hear find noises of a scuffle involving multiple people. It doesn't take long for you to find out the cause: You speed by, and out the window of the car you see Albert Hassel squirming against the wall, handcuffed. He seems to have incurred a bit of aggression from the policemen. They had their batons out. One submitted the portly man to the ground, while the others were prodding and yelling at him. You couldn't help but chuckle to yourself at the astounding emptiness of his bravado.

It takes less than five seconds for you to loose sight of him in the worst day of his life, and speed away.

You stop by the jailer room to talk to some of your colleagues, and you ask about any new people coming in for detention. It's two people, one man and one woman. They're not side by side in the cell block, but the woman's cell was close enough to the scenic route towards the debriefing room. You'd be able to see her too, finally, with your own eyes. You write the cell number down on a piece of scrap paper and you enter the building.

As you come closer and closer to the cell, there's some trepidation, an excitement from a place you don't know very well.

The cells of Central had small letterbox windows that allowed people in the hallway to look at the people inside, but they did not allow the same from the cells. In front of you is such a window, corresponding to the door of cell that contained Nadine Leitzka.

You couldn't help yourself. You had to look in there no matter what.

There lies a praying mantis colored in the pink hues of human flesh, creeping around the walls and the floor. She has already turned over the mattress and was looking for something frantically. Her hair was frazzled like an overgrown bush. She muttered something to herself that was barely audible. Once they get locked up and are stripped of everything that stitches together their own selves, their bravado disappears. They are naked and afraid, reduced to oversized guinea pigs rattling around in cages.

All of the sudden, she stops and looks in the direction of the window. She says nothing, she does nothing. She just seems to stare at you with those sunken baggy eyes and a scowl that said many terrible things. She did not blink. She did not even wince once. Even cornered and trapped, she kept her face on. Larger, rougher men broke in less time. Commendable, to say the least.

You look away and walk to the interrogation room, greeting you with the same heavy metal steel door, the same paint on it with a number and a letter, the same letterbox window that doesn't let anybody see from the inside out. Only big enough to hold you in with the two of them.

You enter it, and Sergeant Bayer and Lieutenant Sessler are already there sitting on the chairs at the opposite end of a metal table. The Sergeant makes a big show of producing his wristwatch and rapping on it loudly, his usual scowl on his egg-shaped face. Bayer, ever the emotional miser, simply acknowledges you with a small nod.

### 4.-- No evidence presented

(start a timer of random duration from 5 seconds to the duration of this block of text - 3 seconds. => transition to gunshot scene, game over) You explain that, despite what the surveillance might suggest and the repeated insistence to the contrary, there was no evidence of malfeasance or wrongdoing on part of either Albert Hassel or Nadine Leitzka. As suspicious one or both may be, it simply did not seem that these people presented a threat to the security of the State, nor did they appear to act in such away that would imply that they take part in any subversive activity. 

You recommend that they should be released at the earliest possible time and conclude the operation [The timer should have activated here, the rest is content that people should not be able to view] with a neutral ending that while unsatisfactory, proves to be an accurate reflection of what a government agency running a surveillance program actually accomplishes. You should not be able to read this, but if you are, please tweet at me that you got Ending Zero at asobulab so I know you're cool.

### 4.1 Mystery Package was passed through (super leader +x and leader -1 no argument needed passthrough)

You report that the veto on file that was supposed to stop the mystery package from arriving in Albert Hassel's mailbox did not exist when the surveillance operation officially started. It was submitted afterwards, a full three hours later going by timestamps provided by Division XIX. Assuming this information is accurate, there are three explanations: The veto was not filled on time, the veto was ignored deliberately, or it was a gross mishap of misplaced memos and forms. Either way, this was an official breach of protocol that you needed to report immediately.

The silence between the two men in front of you refuses to go away. Every time you try to speak up it's as if there was a noose slowly, but surely, squeezing your throat. You observe Sergeant Bayer balling the papers into his tight fist. You can see his knuckles go white and his finger tips redden with the strength of his grip. Lieutenant Sessler stares into the ceiling, surely transfixed by the concrete pattern above him. He rocks back and forth, restless.

You don't really know what to make of it or how to move forward. You'd love to grab the sheaf of yellow and white paper and move on to the next clue, you'd love to bolt out of there, you'd love for some kind of cataclysm to make a hole above you and take you in a whirlwind. Anything to get out of this maniacal sound that Sessler keeps making.

The paper keeps crinkling and crinkling, it's almost as if there is a construction crew in your ear.

Please say something.

Anything.

Anything at all!

PLEASE!

Lieutenant Sessler, begins to speak with a caution you have never seen in the man. "Agent, I think you are mistaking the interrogation with your own writing circle. I'd be more than happy to introduce you to the Bureau of State Affairs and their publications office if you want to be our own Hercule Poirot, but this effort mustn't be on Ministry time and resources."

Sergeant Bayer turns his head, slowly, towards the bald man that is Lieutenant Sessler. He looks like a stone lion sentinel, like those guarding Brandenburg Gate. You can feel the repressed rage boiling inside him. "That's your conclusion, Sessler?" He asks.

"Sergeant, you cannot possibly accept this state-"

"What I believe, Lieutenant." He says, raising his voice to interrupt and impose on Lieutenant Sessler. "Is that a highly detailed explanation has revealed itself. And, this highly detailed explanation makes you responsible for a breach in protocol. And if you want to keep your life, Oskar Sessler, you will produce a better explanation for this much incompetence that is better than 'he made it up'. Do you have it?"

Lieutenant Sessler scoffs and stars gesticulating with his hands, getting redder and redder in the face. "What would you have me do, Bayer?" He shouts. "I suppose you'd love to have me fall to my knees on the floor and grovel to pay for other people's sins, you traitor-born dog!"

Hearing this insult, Sergeant Bayer stands up and motions towards his firearm on his right hand-side. "Lieutenant, I am warning--" he starts to say with a lot more palpable rage in his voice.

"Warn me all you want, Bayer." The Lieutenant responds. "I did my job! And I do not care for questioning of the manner and timeliness of how I do it! I refuse to take any responsibility for a mistake I. Did. Not. Cause." He leans on those last few words, enunciating every vowel. Both men are standing in front of each other, ready and able to tear each other's head off, and you were there to see the bloody spectacle.

"Oh so they are mistakes now, Sessler?" The Sergeant says defiantly. "Now that you have no explanation, am I to believe that this gross dereliction of duty was just an honest mistake?"

"The fact that you managed to stay alive when you were dumped like a bag of shit by the Luisenstadt was a mistake already." Lieutenant Sessler snarls. The Sergeant wasn't expecting that. He flinches and his face reddens completely in the blink of an eye. "Another mistake was to let you live when they found you, and another greater mistake still was to allow you enter this organization instead of giving you the mercy every suffering subhuman creature deserves. You will not question my methods, Bayer. Or I swear, tomorrow you will find yourself on the business end of a firing squad."

"You wish, you insubordinate oaf." Sergeant Bayer snaps back. "This operation was your idea, your brilliant plan to pull all the levers and favors you could get to put a body in front a press camera. The body of the most ordinary factory worker in the German Democratic Republic. If it were up to you, Albert Hassel would be eating gruel, blindfolded in a prison cell no larger than a coffin." He takes a few steps back and breaths deeply before continuing. Wrath continues to pour out of him.

"As it happens, it's my job to get in the way of people like your ilk, Sessler." The Sergeant continues. "The Ministry is not your personal army, and I will see to it that after all is said and done, you face a jury. And I will personally make a point to that you cannot walk away from such incompetence."

Sessler, speechless, looks at you as if he's about to lunge past the edge of the table and crush your skull in a single bite.

Sergeant Bayer motions towards you, a bit calmer than he was 10 seconds ago. "Flawed as it is, " he reassures you. 'We have an operation to conclude and people to process. Please, Agent, proceed for the next item in the agenda.'

### 4.2 Leitzka leaves without telling anyone where (super leader -1 and leader +x)

You note that, by Albert Hassel's own admission, Leitzka went out on regular outings with a destination unknown to him. Given that she hasn't done so during surveillance, and the dearth of evidence on Nadine Leitzka as a person, you'll have to trust that he is at least telling the truth about this particular detail. All things considered, her absences raise questions about who she meets and where.

Lieutenant Sessler leans forward, in what you guess is his attempt to be assertive rather than imposing. "I might not seem like it, gentlemen. But, I believe that the women of this State deserve all our protection. I believe that, while the original objective of this investigation is to determine whether or not Mister Hassel is a subversive agent with designs to usurp our democracy, securing the safety of Miss Leitzka has become a priority of ours that is compatible with our larger objectives."

Sergeant Bayer widens his eyes, and looks towards the Lieutenant with a wry little smirk on his face. "And, how do you reach that conclusion, Sessler?" He says, in a light, airy tone that just layers on the sarcasm.

"Do you not see it?" Lieutenant Sessler chides as he slams finger on the piece of paper that you produced. "Does the behavior of this woman describe a person who enjoys the company of Albert Hassel? You might want to ask yourself that."

Sergeant Bayer, shrugs, his face stuck on that smarmy grimace. "If anything, I'd say that should cast a bigger cloud of suspicion over her, Sessler. This woman goes out of her way to hide herself. She has succeeded, despite the breadth of our information apparatus. And yet, here you are, telling us we should allow her to run amok?"

Lieutenant Sessler waves his hands even more frantically, desperately trying to win the argument. "This is a woman looking for an escape, Sergeant Bayer. Frankly, I'm not surprised that something that requires a level of tact above a goldfish is lost on you."

"This woman could and would avail herself to the services we provide for individual housing. She cannot be ignorant about them." Sergeant Bayer responds with some annoyance in his voice.

The Lieutenant slams the papers on the desk. "And yet, she chooses otherwise! What a calamity!" He cries. He covers his face with his hands, gathering himself a bit before continuing. Odd, you've not seen him do that ever. "People are not machines, Sergeant." He says. "I think such excursions fit a familiar pattern of behavior."

Sergeant Bayer grabs the papers Lieutenant Sessler left on the table and waves them around, imitating Sessler's gesticulations. "Why are we talking about this individual if not for the fact that she is suspect of subversive behavior?!" He roars. "If we must talk about patterns of behavior, I'd say that it's obvious she is hiding something of interest! That much is obvious!"

Lieutenant Sessler isn't having it. He cross his arms and leans back on his chair. "And it is my position, Sergeant, that this woman needs our help and she would be better served away from Hassel and his corrupting influence. Something that we are already doing as they are both in isolation in this very building." He says, a bit more triumphant than warranted.

[You say that Hassel should take priority in questioning, as he is the target of the investigation ]

Lieutenant Sessler slaps his thighs and motions towards you. "See? Even the Agent knows his priorities. We need to look at what that man has to say, and consider ourselves lucky we have another case to pursue once this one is done." Sergeant Bayer is not impressed, and by the way he looks at you he is quite disappointed.

(super leader -1 and leader +1)

[You say nothing]

You leave the Lieutenant and the Sergeant to have their own little standoff and argue it out. You tune it out. You look at the picture of Nadine Leitzka, the only one the Ministry has on her file. She squirms and wriggles in her cell at this very moment, and even then she remains defiant. 

It's those eyes. They're daggers. 

What is she?

Who is she?

...

The Sergeant clears his throat, calling for your attention. You look up, and hurriedly bring the next item of the agenda to their attention.

### 4.3 Hassel did not report Leitzka (super leader +x and leader -1 OR super leader -1 and leader +x)

You report on two statements that, if true, require immediate attention. One, that the owner of the state-restricted literature is indeed Miss Leitzka. Two, that she had in her possession additional literature, in this case pamphlets, that Albert Hassel himself deemed inappropriate and worthy of reporting to the State authority. This proves concretely that Nadine Leitzka is, at the very least, in contact with subversive groups deleterious to the state.

The Sergeant takes the stuffed folder where you have been keeping all your evidence and begins to lay down yellow folio pages and photo stock squares on the metal table.

(If Nadine's Family Picture) You observe a picture of a picture, a child being held by her mother.

(If Sonia) You observe the description of the mystery woman that crashed into the investigation like a deer crossing the road.

(If Mystery Package was passed through) You see the long litany of memos, signed forms, and inquiries about that blasted package.

(If Lietzka leaves) You see a written account of the threats Nadine Leitzka made a few hours ago.

He lays them all out, one next to the other in a row. The Lieutenant, who had been seeing this labor unfold in silence, finally pipes up. "May I ask what is all this for?" 

"Do you see it, Lieutenant?" The Sergeant says, motioning towards his work forcefully. "I don't have time for games, and neither does this investigation." Lieutenant Sessler snarls back.

"Well, I'd say it's rather obvious!" Sergeant Bayer bellows. "We have a book. Now we have pamphlets. Both owned by this Nadine Leitzka. Have I got it correctly, Agent?" He asks you.

(If you have evidence for Wealth of Nation) You agree empathically.

(If you don't have evidence for Wealth of Nations) You stare at the Sergeant, not quite knowing what he means.

"Moreover," The Sergeant continues. "Mister Hassel should have informed us, by his own admission of the existence and content of these pamphlets.  He will have to be processed for obstruction of justice. However I would love to know why are we did the investigation start with the wrong person?"

Lieutenant Sessler's face reddens. In anger, he bangs his fists on the table, scattering the papers on it. "For the hundredth time, Bayer, that's not what the previous intel have told us before!"

"This intel right here disproves that, Lieutenant." Sergeant Bayer snaps. "I don't know how, even for you, it's not crystal clear."

"Hassel is forcing Leitzka to be there against her will!" Lieutenant Sessler says, as he produces the picture of Albert Hassel from the dossier. He jabs his finger on Hassel's face. "Do you see this enlarged mouse of a man truly being able to satisfy the whims of this female character?"

Sergeant Bayer becomes silent. He scrunches his face and crosses his arms. "I'm sorry, I must have blanked out for ten seconds. What does Mister Hassel's appearance have to do with the purposes of our investigation?" He chides.

"Coercion, Bayer! Coercion!" Lieutenant Sessler exclaims, throwing his hands up in the air. "This woman has not demonstrated any thought to call her own and now she's some sort of criminal mastermind out to destroy the country!"

The Sergeant grabs Hassel's picture from Sessler's hands and points at him. "By that logic, this enlarged mouse, as you have decided to call him, should be just as inoffensive. I do not see you extending Albert Hassel the same benefit."

Lieutenant Sessler mutters something under his breath. Sergeant Bayer is even more confused, and commands. "Lieutenant for the love of God speak up, we-"

"She doesn't deserve it!" Lieutenant Sessler shouts.

"On what grounds?!" Sergeant Bayer roars, his annoyance hovering just below the boiling point.

"That she is mine to-" Lieutenant Sessler begins, before being cut off by Sergeant Bayer. "State your accusation clearly, Lieutenant!"

"That her involvement is mine to determine, and she not listed by the intel! The  consists of intercepted mail from a known location of the subversive movement United Left, Sergeant." Sessler says before motioning towards you. "This was beyond the Agent's clearance level, but clearly you have other ideas!"

The Sergeant turns his back and stands facing the wall, tapping his foot. "The mail?" He asks.

"Yes, Bayer. The mail." Lieutenant Sessler responds matter-of-factly.

"We are here, having detained two citizens of this republic without even a small infraction to their names, because of the mail. And we started this process, because of the blasted mail." Sergeant Bayer says, in that kind of tone that precedes something terrible.

"It was good enough for men bigger than you, Bayer! Men better than you! Men who do not betray their country!" Lieutenant Sessler snarls. "It should be good enough for you too!"

Sergeant Bayer turns around, stroking the handle of his pistol as he did. You are taken aback for a few seconds. You fully expected him to unfurl it and discharge from the way he wore that crazed face. "That is inexcusable, Lieutenant. And rest assured I will make a note of this." He whispers.

Lieutenant Sessler scoffs, and breaks out into a mad cackle. "And? Send me to jail then, for being overzealous! For being a stalwart brick of the wall of the protection of this state against traitors! Go on! I dare you!" He spits at Bayer's face as he finishes his invective. Yo expected immediate retaliation for this amount of brazenness.

The tension in the room could smother a sperm whale. Without saying a word, Bayer produces a piece of cloth from one of his breast pockets, and wiped his face. All without breaking eye contact from Hassel's sneering face. The Sergeant stares his subordinate down, with a scowl that could melt the paint off a car. Again, with a silence so sepulchral you swear you could hear people breathing three cells over. 

You can hear a deafening sound thumping in your ears in this mud-like silence. It takes you three seconds to conclude that it's your own heart racing.

The silence continue, and your heartbeat goes louder.

You can't take this anymore.

No amount of preparation would have prepared you for this much in-fighting.

Both of these men could have each other killed.

Could have you killed.

And all you have done wrong is your job.

Your heart, it hurts to even hear it pumping blood frantically.

Someone, make it stop. Please.

And then, a screech.

Lieutenant Bayer gripped the back rest of his chair and is now dragging it slowly across the room, making that unpleasant screeching sound of steel scraping on concrete. He stops and sits away from you and the Sergeant, in the middle of one of the long edges of the table.

As Sergeant Bayer sits, it's Lieutenant Sessler who finally speaks first. "You are assuming, Sergeant, that the book belongs to Nadine Leitzka. I think that assumption is incorrect based on the evidence." He says with a much slower speed and tone.

"And?" The Sergeant asks. "What evidence would that be? It's clear from Miss Lietzka's words that it's hers."

"Sergeant, you can't keep ignoring evidence when it doesn't suit you." The Lieutenant insists. "Hassel has referred to the book's contents before today, he is at least guilty of reading that book."

"And he will be processed for it in due time, Lieutenant." The Sergeant responds. "That doesn't make him an operative of a subversive group that is a threat to our national security. Miss Leitzka is not blameless either. She hid that thing, and did not report it to the local constable."

"Must have been as his direction, Sergeant. There's more than one way to skin this cat." Lieutenant says, his usual annoyance returning to his breath. /n/n "Now now, who is making assumptions now?" Sergeant Bayer says as he gesticulates with his hands some sort of dismissive gesture.

Lieutenant Sessler stretches to get the full dossier, and pulls out sheaves of paper that you recognize. This is your handiwork, typewritten accounts of the conversations that Leitzka and Hassel had had for the past four days. He waves the transcripts around like it was some kind of big revelation.

"What I can surmise, instead of taking any random person at their word," Sessler says. "Is that for all her high-flying theatrics and defiant attitude, this woman has not had one original thought and follows Hassel around like a lapdog."

Sergeant Bayer is visibly taken a back by this statement. "Meaning?" He asks with genuine curiosity.

"If she refers to some objects as her book, her pamphlets, I am not one hundred percent of the mind that the material she refers to as hers truly reflects her beliefs. I believe this woman has been conned, lied to, misdirected, even swindled. We have a monopoly on such practices, Sergeant Bayer. This is a subject of manipulation, I am sure of it. If they were not the enemy I would congratulate them on a job well done, but we must reclaim the territory that is ours by rights and country."

Sergeant Bayer slaps his hand against his face, and sighs heavily as he shakes his head. "I find that hard to believe, for you and for this woman." He hisses.

"And, I find your inability to understand that she is being forced to do something against her will, Sergeant, just as baffling." Lieutenant Sessler says with that little juvenile smirk. His bravado seems to have come back to him.

Unsatisfied, both men stew in their own frustration and anger, unable to convince each other of their own point of view.

[You argue in favor of asking Lietzka about the activities that should have been reported]

You say that Hassel is not a credible source of information, and the Lieutenant is considering him as such. There's no telling what he'll say if it's with the purpose of ruining Leitzka's chances of leaving confinement, or improving his to leave. As such it should be interesting to ask Miss Leitzka about the activities that were supposedly grounds for detention herself, as she would have a vested interest in her own freedom. Sergeant Bayer nods at you and then looks at the Lieutenant Sessler, waiting for some kind of response. Sessler just gives him his usual scowl and looks at you, making quite manifest his displeasure with his teeth.

[You argue in favor of asking Hassel about the activities that should have been reported]

You say that Leitzka would have a vested interest to say anything to save her own hide from Albert Hassel, as it is apparent she does not appreciate his company. Therefore, she is not a credible source of information and the Sergeant is not considering the human factor. Given that Hassel has a greater interest to stay in the good graces of the state, it would be beneficial for the investigation to ask him about the supposed activities that he should have reported. This would a change to either redeem or condemn himself. Lieutenant Sessler smiles his yellowish grin, and clicks his tongue as he thumbs through the pages he had in his hands, so cock-sure you can almost smell the arrogance. Sergeant Bayer gives you a long drawn stare, like a disappointed father with a penchant for physical discipline.

Cut:



Sergeant Bayer in one sweeping unholsters his pistol, cuts the cartridge, and trains it directly at Sessler's forehead. You jump, and motion towards the door by pure reflex. Lieutenant Sessler is surprised and frozen in place, transfixed on the firearm pointing at him. "Right here, in my index finger, I have enough power to stop men like you, Sessler."

The tension in the room could smother a sperm whale. Lieutenant Sessler switch rapidly between looking at the nose-end of Sergeant Bayer's Makarov and back at his face. His gun, then back at him. His gun, then back at him. Seconds elongated into decades.

Slowly, the Lieutenant relaxed his posture and assumed a more submissive demeanor without taking his eyes off the weapon. As he did the Sergeant relaxed his grip on the gun, and lowered his trigger finger back to the grip. "You have rebuffed protocols, guidelines, rulebooks, and laws at every turn. It surprises me you have lasted in this organization for any period of time that's not half a day." He says.

Sergeant Bayer lowers his gun, and his gun and sits back on his chair, without breaking eye contact with Sessler who was still standing. He stares back, motioning towards his empty chair with a great deal of caution. The Sergeant motions at him with the pistol still in his hand, beckoning him to sit.

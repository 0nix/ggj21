## Day 1

###Previous to questioning

As you prepare your dossier for the day's activities, you recieve a phone call from the internal Ministry network. The voice on the other end is monotone, almost sepulchral in it's lack of tone:

"Agent Designation: Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-One-Three. You are required to present yourself at once to Central for dossier review following every day of operation while on assignment. Authorization. Delta-Sierra-Charlie-Hotel. Review of dossier will be conducted by Operations managers. Confirm reciept."

You confirm. Everything about this operation is strange. The timing of the operation, the rushed nature of your briefing, the fact that so many resources were being spent on two people that you had never even heard of being spoken of at any level within the Ministry. Even when everyone is subject to some form of vigilance, a line worker at a factory and his paramore are usually not subject to this much scrutiny. \n\n Even so, an order is an order.

A car ride and the standard security checks later, you are in an interrogation room that is usually for crime suspects. You've been on the side of the metal table where both Lt. Bryce and Sgt. Bayer are looking from. You've also been on this side as a part of counter-intelligence training. Nevertheless, the position you're in does not allow you to feel completely at ease. At least there isn't a scent pad on the bottom of the chair. You're spared persecution from the canine unit, for now.

"Well then, Brownie." Lt. Bryce barks with discomfort. "We have Sgt. Bayer here to thank for a Delta-Sierra style interrogatory. Can't say I'm thrilled to be away from my Marta at this hour, but I am loathe to agree with Bayer. One cannot have too much scrutiny."

"Well, Bryce," Sgt. Bayer responds, with some annoyance. "Our time needs to be spent efficiently and concietiously. Of course, we cannot allow our enemies to go astray but dilligence is the norm or we're no different from those uncouth bastards on the West."

Bryce grimaces at that comment, though he does so with his eyes directly fixed upon you. 

"Agent, you may proceed with the dossier review." Bayer commands. 

### 1.x No evidence presented

Bryce and Bayer sit on a pregnant silence as you explain that, despite what the surveillance might suggest, there was no evidence of malfeacance or wrongdoing on part of either Albert Hassel or Nadine Leitzka. They appeared to be a perfectly normal, perfectly fine couple. 

"Agent, I'm sure that setting up an operation on such short notice is not something you may want to do every day," Bayer quizes. "But, I find it hard to believe that there was a complete lack of any evidence on either party under surveillance."

"Are you trying to pull the wool over our eyes, Brownie? Is Leitzka a friend of yours? Is Hassel?" Bryce accuses, with some anger in his voice. "If so, you are entirely innappropriate for this operation and we have wasted precious resources from your lack of professionalism."

"Now, now Lt. Bryce" Bayer interjects. "No such connections have been established for the Agent. I'm sure given his time in the Ministry he knows better than to keep close association with citizens should it compromise the Operation, and he is required to disclose such relationships on operations and daily briefings." He shuffles through some of the documents in your binder. /n/n "Now, I don't see such a disclosure document from the Agent. If there is a such a relationship, now would be a good time to mention it." /n/n You feel Bayer's absent stare sit on you like an elephant on a cushion.

 You respond there is no such relationship.

### 1.1 Two Hams

Bryce and Bayer hear your report on Hassel's aparent material wealth. Both men stay in silence for a moment. They look at each other with a bit of amusement.

"Really?" Bayer starts to question. "You presume to convict a man on owning one two many cold meats? That's the standard we will be going off on the Ministry now?"

"Bayer, please." Bryce interjects. "Exactly how often can you afford to have a high ticket item on your kitchen that doesn't dissappear in a day, hm? Specially when, as the Agent has said, hams have not been in distribution for weeks?" 

Bayer motions to answer immediately, but pauses for thought. "I certainly have not had ham in a few months. If anything I'd like to stop Albert Hassel to ask where got them." Bryce continues, smugly.

"It's very simple Bryce." Bayer says, with a bit of a laugh. "He froze them. He froze them! You want to detain people for using their freezers, Bryce. Honestly. I don't blame the Agent for think it's odd but there are simpler explanations that do not require government resources." 

"This line of questioning is beyond silly, Agent. I move to expunge it from record and move on." Bayer says. /n/n "Nonsense, Agent. There is a reasonable fear of contraband with foods that did not come from state stores." Bryce says, huffing with discontent.

*Option 1*

[Argue for its inclusion in the record to agree with Bryce]

You argue that Sgt. Bayer's suggestion is plausible, it doesn't account for the shortage of similar food stuffs in recent months. far beyond safe consumption of hams even when frozen. It would be easier to check for a thawed ham, but the couple made no mention of where they got it, and how, and of it's taste. Not enough information is available to disprove contraband. 

Bryce reclines his chair, a bit too triumphant to win in an argument involving hand. Bayer tuts and shakes his head, displeased.

(lambda leader +1 superleader -1)

*Option 2*

[Withdraw the evidence, to agree with Bayer.]

You lend credence to Bayer's objections and make a note to expunge the evidence from the surveillance record. Bryce is non-chalant about it, showing his displeasure with a pursed lip, showing his yellow goulish teeth.

(no change)

### 1.2 Using the radio to drown out a conversation.



### 1.3 Two Sofas on the Lounge



### 1.4 Insatisfaction with the party



### 1.e Ending



Having heard everything you had to report, both men get up from their seats. You respond with a standing salute.

"The surveillance goes on Agent," Bryce hollers. "Do not forget. We are the Shield and Sword of the State. You would do well to remember your oath and duty."

And with that, they leave, leaving you completely alone.

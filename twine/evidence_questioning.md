## Day 1

### Previous to questioning

As you prepare your dossier for the day's activities, you receive a phone call from the internal Ministry network. The voice on the other end is monotone, almost sepulchral in it's lack of tone:

"Agent Designation: Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-One-Three. You are required to present yourself at once to Central for dossier review following every day of operation while on assignment. Authorization. Delta-Sierra-Charlie-Hotel. Review of dossier will be conducted by Operations managers. Confirm receipt."

You confirm. Everything about this operation is strange. The timing of the operation, the rushed nature of your briefing, the fact that so many resources were being spent on two people that you had never even heard of being spoken of at any level within the Ministry. Even when everyone is subject to some form of vigilance, a line worker at a factory and his paramour are usually not subject to this much scrutiny. \n\n Even so, an order is an order.

A car ride and the standard security checks later, you are in an interrogation room that is usually for crime suspects. You've been on the side of the metal table where both Lt. Bryce and Sergeant Bayer are looking from. You've also been on this side as a part of counter-intelligence training. Nevertheless, the position you're in does not allow you to feel completely at ease. At least there isn't a scent pad on the bottom of the chair. You're spared persecution from the canine unit, for now.

"Well then, Brownie." Lt. Bryce barks with discomfort. "We have Sergeant Bayer here to thank for a Delta-Sierra style interrogatory. Can't say I'm thrilled to be away from my Marta at this hour, but I am loathe to agree with Bayer. One cannot have too much scrutiny."

"Lieutenant Bryce," Sergeant Bayer responds, with some annoyance. "Our time needs to be spent efficiently and conscientiously. Of course, we cannot allow our enemies to go astray but diligence is the norm or we're no different from those uncouth bastards on the West."

Bryce grimaces at that comment, though he does so with his eyes directly fixed upon you. 

"Agent, you may proceed with the dossier review." Bayer commands. 

### 1.x No evidence presented

Bryce and Bayer sit on a pregnant silence as you explain that, despite what the surveillance might suggest, there was no evidence of malfeasance or wrongdoing on part of either Albert Hassel or Nadine Leitzka. They appeared to be a perfectly normal, perfectly fine couple. 

"Agent, I'm sure that setting up an operation on such short notice is not something you may want to do every day," Bayer quizzes. "But, I find it hard to believe that there was a complete lack of any evidence on either party under surveillance."

"Are you trying to pull the wool over our eyes, Brownie? Is Leitzka a friend of yours? Is Hassel?" Bryce accuses, with some anger in his voice. "If so, you are entirely inappropriate for this operation and we have wasted precious resources from your lack of professionalism."

"Now, now Lt. Bryce" Bayer interjects. "No such connections have been established for the Agent. I'm sure given his time in the Ministry he knows better than to keep close association with citizens should it compromise the Operation, and he is required to disclose such relationships on operations and daily briefings." He shuffles through some of the documents in your binder. /n/n "Now, I don't see such a disclosure document from the Agent. If there is a such a relationship, now would be a good time to mention it." /n/n You feel Bayer's absent stare sit on you like an elephant on a cushion.

 You respond there is no such relationship.

### 1.1 Two Hams

Bryce and Bayer hear your report on Hassel's apparent material wealth. Both men stay in silence for a moment. They look at each other with a bit of amusement.

"Really?" Bayer starts to question. "You presume to convict a man on owning one two many cold meats? That's the standard we will be going off on the Ministry now?"

"Bayer, please." Bryce interjects. "Exactly how often can you afford to have a high ticket item on your kitchen that doesn't disappear in a day, hmm? Specially when, as the Agent has said, hams have not been in distribution for weeks?" 

Bayer motions to answer immediately, but pauses for thought. "I certainly have not had ham in a few months. If anything I'd like to stop Albert Hassel to ask where got them." Bryce continues, smugly.

"It's very simple Bryce." Bayer says, with a bit of a laugh. "He froze them. He froze them! You want to detain people for using their freezers, Bryce. Honestly. I don't blame the Agent for think it's odd but there are simpler explanations that do not require government resources." 

"This line of questioning is beyond silly, Agent. I move to expunge it from record and move on." Bayer says. /n/n "Nonsense, Agent. There is a reasonable fear of contraband with foods that did not come from state stores." Bryce says, huffing with discontent.

*Option 1*

[Argue for its inclusion in the record to agree with Bryce]

You argue that while Sergeant Bayer's suggestion is plausible, it doesn't account for the shortage of similar food stuffs in recent months. far beyond safe consumption of hams even when frozen. It would be easier to check for a thawed ham, but the couple made no mention of where they got it, and how, and of it's taste. Not enough information is available to disprove contraband. 

Bryce reclines his chair, a bit too triumphant to win in an argument involving hand. Bayer tuts and shakes his head, displeased.

(lambda leader +2 superleader -1)

*Option 2*

[Withdraw the evidence, to agree with Bayer.]

You lend credence to Bayer's objections and make a note to expunge the evidence from the surveillance record. Bryce is nonchalant about it, showing his displeasure with a pursed lip, showing his yellow ghoulish teeth.

(no change)

### 1.2 Using the radio to drown out a conversation.

Bryce and Bayer hear your reports about Leitzka and Hassel having a conversation that seems to be deliberately drowned out with a radio broadcast.

After a pause, Bryce asks "What time did this broadcast happen?"

You answer that it was around 0900 hours. 

"Oh so, they're guilty of listening to the morning news with Raquel Gant." Bryce spits back with incredulity. "I listen to that show too. By your logic, Agent, I should be led away to a cell in handcuffs right now."

"I think there's a little more to this than just a loud radio." Bayer says. "Subject wasn't just listening to the radio as a matter of habit, and just happened to have a conversation while the radio was still on. I think they turned on the radio to talk. The contents of the broadcast itself are largely irrelevant. They were seeking the noise to cover up their conversation. It's a pity that this is just the first day of surveillance."

"It's a pity we are not increasing surveillance on a potential subversive element, Bayer?" Bryce asks. "It's almost as if that's exactly what we are doing."

"You knew well what I mean Lieutenant, being obtuse gets us nowhere." Bayer barks at Bryce, with annoyance. "We cannot establish a pattern unless we see a repeated incidence of behavior, but I do believe this should be entered into evidence."

"It's a coincidence, Sergeant Bayer." Bryce proclaims. "Nothing more, nothing less."

*Option 1*

[Argue for its inclusion in the record to agree with Bayer]

You argue that Sgt. Bayer's suggestion is plausible, and how it could be the start of establishing a pattern of behavior. Small bits of behavior may tell off a larger offense to prosecute under state law.

Bayer looks in Bryce's direction with an air of smugness, while Bryce rolls his eyes.

(lambda leader -1 superleader +2)

*Option 2*

[Withdraw the evidence, to agree with Bryce.]

You lend credence to Bryce's objections and make a note to expunge the evidence from the surveillance record. Bryce purses his lips, and moves on to the next part of the interrogation. Bayer tuts.

(no change)

### 1.3 Two Sofas on the Lounge

Bryce and Bayer listen to you make a note of Hassel owning two sofas not being much in line with someone of his earned income and station. Evidence may suggest that he is receiving more money than is reported in official documentation.

"Agent, there are hundreds of explanations that fit this piece of evidence that are much simpler than any malfeasance in another department that's not yours." Bayer chides.

"Not to mention that's there's already something in file that explains this course of action, Hassel was unfortunately involved with an element that has been taken care of and if I think owning a piece of furniture from a friend is not against the law." Bryce agrees, a surprised look on his face. /n/n "Now, Agent, please tell us why we should even entertain this piece of evidence to be included into the dossier." Bayer says, rapping his finger on the papers.

*Option 1*

[Previous association with a detained subject.]

You say that precisely owning belongings that are potentially from a previous association are more than enough to arise suspicion of subversive attitudes. The rational thing would have been to shun and disassociate from the relation for one's own benefit and the country's.

Bryce nods in agreement. Bayer shakes his head. "If the Lieutenant wants to continue with our previous pattern in leaping to conclusions, I cannot help but think this is a gross misuse of state resources." /n/n "What do you mean, Bayer?" Bryce asks, annoyed. /n/n Sergeant Bayer sighs and raises his hands. "Add it to the record if you want, Bryce. I will not be co-signing sloppy work."

(lambda superleader -1)

[Insist on the money angle.]

You insist that owning multiple pieces of this kind of furniture was not something that Hassel could afford easily, let alone with his time as a worker in the electronics factory he labored. Even if there were other, simpler explanations, they should not deter from the fact that this a pattern interrupt that needs to be on the record.

Bayer rests his hand on his face for a few seconds, processing the information. He reads the papers, mouthing the words written. "I think this may have some merit, Agent." He finally says. "Not the best piece of evidence we've had against a potentially subversive element, but worth following up on should the prosecution deem it needed." 

"Unbelievable," Bryce says, angrily. "This kind of reasoning is going to convince you to note the subject's choice of home décor. This will put anti-citizen elements behind bars, Bryce? Really?" He says with and increasingly louder voice.

"I was very clear with my assessment, Lieutenant." Bayer responds, leaning on the last word of that sentence. "I think it's worth pursuing for any other behaviors that are not consistent. The Agent's right to point it out even if it's slim."

(lambda leader -1)

### 1.4 IN satisfaction with the party

A very clearly stated dissatisfaction with the state of government and the Party, while not in and of itself an act of treason or subversion, is often the gateway to subversive attitudes and affiliations. /n/n You were about to explain this, when both the Lieutenant and the Sergeant interrupt you. "Agent." Bryce says. "No need to go on about that matter. It has to be on the record as a matter of form. We've always done that." /n/n "Of course," Bayer responds. "This is just protocol. However I do have to wonder what could have motivated this outburst."

"Could have been simply that we created the dissatisfaction?" Bayer inquires. "We have put him on the no-exit visa list as a matter of form previous to the investigation. This might just be this man annoyed at something we did. He had never been in our interest sphere before, so some manner of discomfort is justified."

"We didn't start surveillance on this man out of the blue, Sergeant." Bryce responds. "This fits a pattern of behavior that precisely justifies surveillance. Intelligence has put him on a list for reasons of state security If Division XXI has reason to suspect something through independent informants, then we should heed their call."

[Agree with Bryce]

Bryce grunts with an affirmative tone. "Right you are, Agent. Right you are."

(lambda leader +2)

[Agree with Bayer]

Bayer hums with a bit of a humorous tone. "In his position I'd be upset too."

(Lambda superleader +2)

### 1.e Ending

Having heard everything you had to report, both men get up from their seats. You respond with a standing salute.

"The surveillance goes on Agent," Bryce hollers. "Do not forget. We are the Shield and Sword of the State. You would do well to remember your oath and duty."

And with that, they leave. You are now completely alone. 

## Day 2 

### Previous to questioning

As you take off your heavy headphones and prepare the desk for your night shift surveillance partner, you receive a phone call from the internal Ministry network. The voice on the other end is the same monotone that had preluded the interrogation from yesterday.

"Agent Designation: Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-One-Three. You are required to present yourself at once to Central for dossier review following every day of operation while on assignment. Authorization. Delta-Sierra-Charlie-Hotel. Review of dossier will be conducted by Operations managers. Confirm receipt."

You respond affirmatively. Fifteen minutes later, in the same office, in the same building, with the same yellow light illuminating a balding crow and a stoic rock. Two men who will decide the merits of your investigation.

"Delta-Sierra interrogation day number two. I do hope that the evidence presented too day will be more fortuitous and conducive to establishing any and all culpability for Mr. Hassel." Bryce says, chewing something before spitting it out in a nearby bin.

"Plausible culpability, Lieutenant Bryce." Bayer says with a stern tone. "Plausible culpability."

"Excuse me, how many years have you been in service to the Ministry Sergeant Bayer?" Bryce responds, offended.

"Enough to have out ranked you, Lieutenant." Bayer says in low tones, unmoved by Bryce's accusations.

### No evidence presented

Bryce and Bayer sit on a pregnant silence as you explain that, despite what the surveillance might suggest, there was no evidence of malfeasance or wrongdoing on part of either Albert Hassel or Nadine Leitzka. They appeared to be a perfectly normal, perfectly fine couple. 

"Agent, I'm sure that setting up an operation on such short notice is not something you may want to do every day," Bayer quizzes. "But, I find it hard to believe, even after two days of surveillance, that there was a complete lack of any evidence on either party under surveillance."

"I find your lack of work to be disturbing at best, and worthy of being accused of constituting sabotage." Bryce added, growling like a dog. 

### 2.1 Promotion

You report on a subject of the investigation, Albert Hassel, reportedly getting promoted to Engineer Team Lead at the State Electronic Fabricator Plant no. 3, supervised by one Gerhart Kleiner. Electronic Fabricator Plant no. 3 currently produces boards and chip sets for the state's Official Computer Manufacture that provides support and tools to offices both domestic and in allied countries. While not absolutely critical, the Fabricator Plant is an important sector of enterprise in the State, and it's organizational structure is cleared and reviewed constantly by the Ministry itself.

"Well, there you go Bayer." Bryce says with a bit of a grin. "You have been asking over and over for a justification for this surveillance operation on Hassel. I'd say this is it. If Division XX has a reason to direct further work on the newest member of Worker Management, I don't see why wouldn't we."

Bayer furrows his brow, puzzled. "I get that, I get that." He mutters. "It's not clear to me that we have had this level of mid management, specially if it's something that..." He trails off in thought.

"Specially if what, Sergeant? Be more specific, please." Bryce responds through gritted teeth.

"I don't see this much scrutiny over a move that, frankly sounds like a fat accompli. Frankly, from the way the conversation has been recorded and presented to us, Hassel's promotion is something that has already gone through the proper scrutiny channels, at the appropriate levels." Bayer says, scratching his chin still in a pensive mood.

"Are you saying that Division XX has engaged in dubious intelligence, Sergeant Bayer? If so, that is a very tall accusation that requires some ev-" Bryce accuses.

"And my question to you Bayer is, do you have someone in Division XX you care this much?" Bayer responds, with that particular tone people use when they want to re-establish their authority. "They're good Lieutenant, but they're not gods. They're not infallible. Your defensiveness is becoming unreasonable, comrade and you are constantly forgetting yourself."

The Sergeant turns to you and says. "At any rate, I think this is still useful Agent. We should look into this Gerhart Kleiner, and his relationship with Hassel as well as who cleared the usual check on his promotion."

"I agree with the Sergeant on that matter, Agent. Even if I... disagree with his thoughts at the moment." Bryce says with a heavy sigh.

"We have to decide on angle," Bayer mutters, playing with the papers on the desk. Bryce as always sits back, his hands crossed and his beady eyes looking directly at you.

[Argue to investigate the Division XX background check]

You say that a perfectly fine citizen who is being slated to be promoted within state business must have had a record check done with a level of thoroughness that would have been all that was necessary to establish prosecutable offenses. That this individual is now under dedicated surveillance is not protocol. /n/n Sergeant Bayer grunts in agreement and takes a note.

(lambda superleader +2)

[Argue to investigate Kleiner and the factory]

You say that the involvement of a factory supervisor of a state-owned operation adds an additional wrinkle to the surveillance operation, since such a position would allow a potential subversive element into sabotaging larger state interests and industries. The question the follows if Kleiner is involved into the matters that Hassel is being suspected of, and as such has become a suspect himself. Out of an abundance of caution, he and the factory operation should be investigated /n/n Lieutenant Bryce smirk's, and looks at Sergeant Bayer with some manner of contempt.

(lambda leader +2)

### 2.2 Lying about meeting production quotas (super leader -1 AND leader +1)

You relate to Lieutenant Bryce and Sergeant Bayer that, from the way Leitzka had spoken, there may had been some tampering of the production reports for The People's Electronics Fabricant. Namely, their production numbers. The expression "made like thieves" could apply to several different contexts, including in this case a probable cause to investigate Albert Hassel's and Gerhart Kleiner's involvement in day-to-day operation. It may be indicative of, at the very least, a deliberate change in policy that has not been approved by the Ministry of Labor, or any officially sanctioned policy by The Party.

You did not even have time to draw an additional breath of stale air before Lt. Bryce slid his chair backwards, stood up and started to pack his belongings, motioning to leave. Sergeant Bayer looks at him dumbfounded, his arms crossed, as if he had committed some egregious faux pas. You didn't even know yourself if you were to stand up or sit, since both officers had a completely different idea of what to do next. 

"May I ask why are you getting up Lieutenant?" Sergeant Bayer asks with an inquisitional tone of voice with a sting of authority, a mother catching her child in-fraganti scribbling on the walls. /n/n Lt. Bryce looks at you, then at Sergeant Bryce, then at you, then at the Sergeant again. You can't tell if this is some kind of act or if he's genuinely confused. "You-you-you're not leaving Bayer?" he asks. /n/n "No I'm not, Lieutenant" Sergeant Bayer responds dryly, leaning on the last word and making sure he enunciated every syllable. "And neither are you, we have not discussed this piece of evidence in any capacity."

"I'm sorry, but pray tell what is there to discuss?" Bryce spat at Bayer as he sat again. "It should be an open and shut case, we have something that is in flagrant violation of state law."

"Well, I don't know about that." Bayer opines. "'Making like thieves' she says? I would pause and take care to know what that means."

Bryce scoffs at what clearly is, in his mind, a questioning of the abundantly obvious. "They have stolen from the State, Sergeant Bayer! They have stolen from you, from me, from u-"

"Is that so? On that comment alone you plan on ending this investigation?" Bayer interrupts. "That must mean you also plan to arrest Gerhart Kleiner, I presume? How about the rest of the plant? How about we go after every single person working at that plant until the industrial capacity of the State grinds to screeching halt on the off-hand comments of this woman? Will that satisfy you, Bryce?" 

"Wouldn't it behoove us to investigate every possible threat to the integrity of the state, Sergeant Bayer? It is my duty, and yours too." Bryce growls back.

Sergeant Bayer shakes his head. "This is a preposterous conversation, " he says "Agent, let's move onto further bui-"

"I think not, Agent." Lieutenant Bryce interjects. "Agent, you will enter this into the record and you will make an official note to investigate Gerhart Kleiner and every other of his associates for any possible wrong doing at the electronics factory." He then turns to Bayer, and looks at him straight in the eye. "I will not stand idly by, Bayer. Even if you think this is ridiculous."

["The note will reach you through telefax at the soonest available moment, Lieutenant." You respond.]

"Excuse me, Agent. Lieutenant." Bayer says, a grave aggressive humdrum in his voice that called attention to his rank. "Know your places, or I would transfer you to the mailing room for insubordination. This operation is under my purview and jurisdiction. Gerhart Kleiner and the factory workers are not part of surveillance and they will not be added to it."

He stares daggers into you. "Do I make myself clear, gentlemen?" You nod and Lieutenant Bryce smirks with his yellow teeth. You think he is trying to convey some sort of camaraderie. You nod at him too. 

 (super leader -1 AND leader +2)

["I believe that would be your duty as the superior officer, sir. I am not qualified to make such determinations." You respond.]

"Well met Agent, and it is my duty to co-sign said determinations." Bayer adds with a bit of a triumphant tone to his voice. "And while I commend you Agent for respecting the chain of command, I must admonish you for bringing circumstantial evidence to this investigation." 

He continued to talk, this time to Lieutenant Bryce, but deliberately kept his sight on you. "And I would be quite appreciative that my loyalty to the State be not called into question by you, Lieutenant. I will not have a gung-ho crazed apparatus attacking its citizens without reason, and this starts within."

Lieutenant Bryce scoffs and grabs his sheaf of papers, looking to exit the conversation into the next item of the agenda.

(Nothing)

### 2.3 Owning Wealth of Nations (super leader +1 OR leader +1)

You report that in the preliminary sweep of Albert Hassel's apartment you found a book that was clearly of some relevance to Leitzka. Upon inspection, you discover that the book was entitled "Wealth of Nations", translated. The book had a dust jacket on to make it look like as if it was a cookbook, which was clearly an attempt to hide it's contents. This was a likely attempt to hide the contents of the book and as such highly suspicious of being an unauthorized publication, worthy of mentioning.

Both Lieutenant Bryce and Sergeant Bayer nod in unison, Bryce chuckles a bit while Bayer rubs his stubble.

"Well, well," Bryce says in a playful tone. "This is worth being late for dinner."

"I'll say. Someone is going to be charged with possession of state-prohibited literature." Bayer snorts. "When was that book banned, Lieutenant?"

"Since Yalta, for all I care." Bryce says, handwaving the question away as if it wasn't even uttering.

"Agent, do you have any indication of who owned that book?" Bayer asks you.

"Again with the silly questions, Sergeant. You're missing the point!" Bryce interjects, not allowing you to answer. "It clearly belongs to Hassel, and even if it we have a probable cause to arrest and prosecute this man."

"Well, Lieutenant, let's not get ahead of ourselves." Bayer responds in an almost professorial tone. "It's not enough."

"Not enough?" Bryce chides in disbelief. "Not enou-Do you want to do your job with snow mittens, Bayer, or are you a Sergeant of the Ministry of State Security?"

"Lieutenant, I must insist. Let's not get ahead of ourselves." Bayer says in the same professorial tone, leaning on every syllable to get his point across. "I am not disagreeing on the merits of the evidence itself."

Lieutenant Bayer leans back, his chair scraping the concrete floor and making that awful noise once again. "Then enlighten us, O Wise One!" He says with the same nasally mocking tone one would expect from a schoolyard fight.

Sergeant Bayer glares at Lieutenant Bryce for a few seconds before responding. "I find it hard to believe that literature that has been banned from this country since it's very founding simply appeared on the living room table of a citizen that, up until now, has not had a prior record of unpatriotic activity."

"Does that truly matter, Bayer?" Bryce grunts with derision.

"Oh I don't know, is the Pope catholic?" Sergeant Bayer responds with the same mocking tone as Bryce adopted. "Of course it matters, it means that if we maintain the surveillance we can learn from a possible end of the line of a subversive chain of command, unmolested by the knowledge they are being watched. That book must have come from somewhere and we must know who smuggled it in."

Lieutenant Bryce started chuckling. "Unbelievable" he whispers.

"Excuse me, Lieuten-" Bryce starts to admonish.

"You're unbelievable, Sergeant, I swear. We have a criminal here. Is that not enough for this unit anymore? Do you want to have this criminal here corrupting the mind of another citizen of this Republic, with words you and I know are completely against the Party and everything we stand for. And you want it to let it slide? You want to let it go like it was nothing! That is what's unbelievable, Sergeant Bayer."

Sergeant Bayer adjusts his black necktie and grabs the first few papers from the surveillance dossier. "Let us remind ourselves, Lieutenant Bryce, the purpose of this mission." He says with tremendous condescension in his voice. "According to the documents here, this operation looked to establish culpability of being related or being a member of a subversive organization with designs to disrupt the security and harmony of the State, is that not? Wasn't that very suspicion, a suspicion you found to be credible beyond my purview mind you, what brings us here every night?" /n/n Bryce stays silent, refusing to respond.

Bayer hounds him further. "Is it not, Lieutenant Bryce? Group membership? Something this book may be evidence of but has yet to indicate any additional persons?" He inquires.

Bryce continues to stay silent, Bayer tuts and shakes his head in disgust.

"It is, Lieutenant. What we have here is an illegal book. There is merit in pursuing that investigative line through our current surveillance, it would concern us where Hassel got that book. They are a clear and present enemy." Sergeant Bayer says, in that sort of manner when you announce you're done discussing a topic. 

Lieutenant Bryce disagrees. "And I say, get him right now to an interrogation chamber, and we'll know right away."

Sergeant Bayer massages his temples, clearly annoyed. "Wrong! He does not benefit in any way in telling us anything we might think is the truth and I would not like to go and spin on the word of a criminal if it can lead us to what is the true enemy of the state."

"What you're suggesting is waiting." Lieutenant Bryce responds with disgust. "No problem gets solved by waiting."

[You argue that in any other circumstance the detention of Albert Hassel would be immediate, given the delicate situation it would be advisable to allow him to think he's not being watched.]

Bryce nods in approval, tutting. "I have to agree with Agent Brownie. I don't want these traitor rats to smell the poison as it kills them. Let us wait first to see the extent of these wretched individuals, and we'll see who are they and how many." 

(leader +2)

[You argue that given Hassel's history, he might be even an unwitting door to a subversive organization that has the potential of appearing on the surveillance during the coming days.]

Bayer grunts in approval. "It's nice to see some actual intelligence work suggested from the agent who will perform it." He looks into your eyes, smiling a grin a devil would admire. "We'll be there watching, and we might just arrest and jail the traitors and the Western scum who want to destroy us from the inside out."

(superleader +2)

### 2.4 Nadine Leitzka's Picture (super leader +1 AND leader -1)

You explain that the surveillance feed captured Nadine Leitzka crying over an object that was stored in the suitcase that she deliberately put away. It's safe to assume that the object that she cried over is this picture. It would be relevant to the investigation who are the people in the picture, and their clear important significance. You hand over the instant picture you took with the Pentacon 6 you had on hand at the time. A picture of a picture is a bit silly, but given the time constraints it was the best way to document the evidence.

Sergeant Bayer looks at the dossier, then at the picture, then the dossier, then the picture again, puzzled.

Lieutenant Bryce crosses his arms and leans back, with a smug little smirk. "I had suspected that vermin Hassel had Ms. Leitzka against her will. I'm no specialist in human behavior, but I would surmise that crying over a family picture is proof that at the very least she is being kept away from people she cares about, no?"

Bayer continues to look over the dossier files with a furrowed brow. "Strange," he says. "Her profile does not contain any information about living or even deceased family members. There are no names, no addresses, just a picture from her likeness, and her general identity card information. Nothing to support that picture is of her family, Lieutenant Bryce."

Bryce emitted a cackle that might pass for laugh with generous consideration. "Ha, next you'll be telling us she came out, fully formed and grown, from the ocean spray inside a clam and she was clothed by nymphs and magical creatures, Sergeant."

Sergeant Bayer glared daggers into Bryce's skull. "Har har har, Lieutenant. Always a comedian. Never a laugh." He spits. "As is expected, you miss the point entirely. I've seen shoddy intel work, but this..." He moves his hands around the dossier he was just riffling through as if it was rotting meat. "This is horrible, Lieutenant."

"Do you care all of the sudden about the quality of our internal processes, Bayer? How convenient." Lieutenant Bryce snidely quips.

"As a matter of fact, yes. Yes I do." Sergeant Bayer responds with an air of self-importance. "This woman of no name  is part of an investigation by being associated to a citizen up until a week ago had no previous record, and the lack of intel we have on her just doesn't bother you? It doesn't bother you even in the slightest, Lieutenant Bryce? I would say the biggest suspicion would be on this woman! Technically, I think we have to stop her the moment she crosses the door of that flat because we don't even have a regular police check on record of her. We don't even have an add-"

"What do you mean Sergeant? She clearly lives with Albert Hassel!" Bryce responds with and increased annoyance in his voice. 

"You'd think that, of course, but her address on file is not the one listed for Hassel. I don't think she even lives in that location, and I'm starting to doubt it even exists... Lieutenant, you are being quite flippant, even as this gross error is in your hands." Sergeant Bayer says, with a severe demeanor.

"Oh please, Sergeant Bayer, you can't possibly mean I--" Lieutenant Bryce starts to defends himself.

"Answer me, Bryce. Why is there so little information on this woman? So little that we don't even know who the people in her picture even are? If not you, who must we blame for this much incompetence?" Sergeant Bayer accuses, raising the volume of his voice with every question.

"That's immaterial, and not a part of this interrogatory procedure, Sergeant Bayer." Bryce responds with gritted teeth.

Sergeant Bayer purses his lips and takes a small notepad from his breast pocket to jot down something. As he does that, he mutters. "Much like your work, Lieutenant. Immaterial." /n/n He finishes jotting whatever it is that he was writing down and addresses you directly. "So, Agent. What do we do now about this picture of, for all we know, perfect strangers?"

[You decide that tenuous evidence is simply not worth keeping considering the preponderant lack of information.]

Sergeant Bayer lets out a heavy sigh. "You're right, Agent. We know too little, and this picture is largely meaningless without that information." With this, he tears the picture in two pieces and balls the pieces in his fist tightly. Lieutenant Bryce watches him do this, with a hateful glare.

[Investigate internal intelligence for the reason why the profile on Nadine Leitzka is so skim in details, and keep the picture in the folder.]

"Normally, I'd be against keeping thinly substantiated evidence in a surveillance. But,I will have to agree, Agent. We have a problem in internal intelligence, or it might be on records, or somewhere else. Either way, this has to be examined." Sergeant Bayer said, nodding as he did. /n/n "And I guess you'll get your hands dirty figuring out why, Bayer" Lieutenant Bryce snidely remarks. /n/n Sergeant Bayer looks at his counterpart dead in the eye and pauses on every syllable. "Even if I have to dive into the pile myself."

(super leader +2 AND leader -1)

### 2.5 Hastily scribbled map (super leader -1 AND leader +1)

You explain that the surveillance feed captured Nadine Leitzka hurriedly putting away a suitcase you opened to investigate. It's safe to assume that the she seeks to hide the objects in it and this is the most notable. It would be relevant to the investigation where, if anywhere, does this map depict and its significance. You hand over the instant picture you took with the Pentacon 6 you had on hand at the time. A picture of a picture is a bit silly, but given the time constraints it was the best way to document the evidence.

Sergeant Bayer looks at the picture and squints at it. "My, my." He coos. "What do we have here? Our little songbird wants to fly." He hands over the picture to Lieutenant Bryce before continuing. "I wish we could make out what this is, I have never been good at recognizing bits and pieces of maps, as much as I hate to admit it. I'd rather source our dedicated cartographers, but given the time sensitivity of the operation we will have to improvise."

Sergeant Bayer motions towards you. "So, Agent. I hope you remember what you learned in covert cartography at the Academy. What does this thing depict, and is it relevant to our investigation?"

Lieutenant Bryce interjects. "Please Sergeant, allow me." He says, with a grin so wide and yellow it might be the crescent moon. "I think I recognize this curved, squiggled line here." He says, jabbing his finger on the photograph. "It should be the Anti-Fascist Protection Wall."

Sergeant Bayer is taken a bit aback. "Really, Lieutenant Bryce? But it doesn't look like there's anything written on it to indicate that."

"Yes, yes, you are correct." Lieutenant Bryce responds with confidence, hand waving as he dismisses the Sergeant. "It doesn't have anything written on it, but it appears to be just a spot near it where she might have agreed to meet someone. Somewhere near the wall, I'm sure of it."

"You sound confident, Lieutenant. It will still go under the review of Division XV Cartography, but if you are correct we can advance the investigation by that much. Agent, I'd like your thoughts. Is this the Protection Wall?" Sergeant Bayer asks, addressing you.

[Agree with Lieutenant Bryce empathically, it is the Protection Wall.]

"Well, Agent." Sergeant Bayer says with derision. "I guess we should replace our cartographers with you and Bryce, here. Since we are so adept at telling squiggles and doodles apart from mere scribbles to maps. Isn't that charming?" /n/n "Can it, Bayer. You can't admit a point when it isn't yours and it's pathetic." Lieutenant Bryce spits with even more hostility.

(leader +1 super leader -1)

[Agree with Lieutenant Bryce but communicate your doubts about the accuracy of the reading.]

"Stop coaxing the poor man, Bayer." Lieutenant Bryce chides. "You will see that I am right." /n/n "We will see, Lieutenant Bryce, we will see." Sergeant Bayer responds with a bit airiness in his voice, looking for the next item in the agenda.

[Disagree with Lieutenant Bryce / You don't really want to do this (roll on a jumpscare and loop back to the question C:<)]

### 2.6 Mystery Package (super leader -1 AND leader +1)

You explain that there has been a package delivered to Albert Hassel's post box. Which would be normal in any other circumstance, but as a matter of standard surveillance, all deliveries are postponed until the subject is either cleared of any suspicion or processed for imprisonment.

When Lieutenant Bryce hears this, he chuckles for a good ten seconds. He seems pleased with himself. "Well, well, well, Bayer. I'd say some explanation is in order. You, yes you Sergeant." He taunts, saying Bayer's title in a mocking tone. "We required authorization from you to begin the operation did we not? I believe we did... yes. So, care to explain why Ministry Policy Seven-One-Four-Q-A was not enforced? All suspects involved in a sur-"

To your surprise he does not respond to the provocation. Sergeant Bayer continues to drone on the policy rule, almost as if reading from a punch card "All suspects involved in a surveillance operation must not receive mail or packages that have not been examined, recorded, and otherwise noted to the investigative party." He then turns to the Lieutenant. "I fail to see the merits of quizzing me on standard ministry procedure."

"I don't think you do, Sergeant Bayer." Lieutenant Bryce continues to taunt. "That requisition to the mail room clearly did not happen. We have a package that did not appear on the Ministry teletype. So, that would make the superior officer of this investigation, in this case a one Sergeant Berthold Bayer, responsible for making such a requisition." He leans in closer to the Sergeant's face, clearly looking for trouble. "Now, tell me. Did that requisition actually happen or did the right hand have to write a writ of intent to the left to get back to it in a weak, huh?"

All of sudden, Sergeant Bayer stand at attention. He towers over Lieutenant Bryce, by almost 20 centimeters. He glares at Bryce like he was sure his stare alone could melt him to a puddle. He takes a while to open his mouth but when he does, it is a low tone growl that sits like a rock in your stomach. "I have had enough of your insults, Bryce. I followed standard procedure without fail for this sham of an operation I had the duty to oversee. And if we are handing out accusations of failing to follow procedure like it was candy, I should remind you of your own too."

He snatches the increasingly unwieldy folio and shoves it into Bryce's chest. "The requisition is part of standard form Five-One-Eight-Zero-Eight, which I signed at the start of this investigation. Evidence of which is in this investigation dossier." 

Bryce grabs the folio and throws it on the table, scattering some of its contents. " Now, you expect me to believe that, Bayer? Or is that a gotcha just passed by the General Assembly in the last hour?" /n/n Bayer motions towards you "The fact that you, the agent, and myself are in this room talking right now should be proof enough." /n/n Bryce stands his ground. "Really? How so?" /n/n Bayer pulls from his inner breast pocket a small brown book, you recognize it instantly as the Ministry of State Security Manual of Procedures and Directives. "Since we are quoting the good book here's one for you." He manages to open it in the exact page he needs to before reciting, "A Delta-Sigma-Charlie-Hotel interrogation requires expedited acceptance of form Five-One-Eight-Zero-Eight at a Sergeant level or higher for high interest cases and operations." He closes the book and crosses his arms. "Or maybe you can't get enough of me and the agent, so you just do this every night for fun?"

Lieutenant Bryce produces his own copy of the Manual from his breast pocket and slams it on the table. "Passing the buck, are we Bayer? Perhaps you're not the sterling image of procedure you purport your self to be after all. Frankly I expected as much of you, a busybody like yourself doesn't get himself in such a cushy job above his seniors in the force."

At this accusation, Sergeant Bayer finally raises voice enough to yell in anger. "Lieutenant Bryce, I will not tolerate this! I will not be blamed for a departmental error on Division XIX and I will not stand by and be accused of such!"

"Yes, shout you fool!" Lieutenant Bryce barks. "So, what will it be? Either it was you who did not do their work, or do we simply flag this as you suggest Bryce, a departmental error?"

[This was a break from procedure.]

"Agent! You shall refrain from accusing your commanding superior of malfeasance or so help me God I will have you in a cell without windows for five months for insubordination!" Sergeant Bryce snaps at you, while Lieutenant Bryce smirks at you. He likes this show of loyalty a bit too much.

(super leader -1 AND leader +2)

[This was a departmental error.]

Sergeant Bayer tightens his fists and lets out a deep sigh. After a small silence he returns to his normal tone of voice. "We seem to need to investigate a breach in protocol for the department and meter out appropriate punishments for parties involved. Division XIX will have to respond to this, and I'm sure there's a rational explanation." Bayer looks at you and nods, acknowledging you. Lieutenant Bryce looks at you briefly and squints. He accuses you of being a coward without saying a word.

### 2.x Conclusion

Having heard everything you had to report, both men get up from their seats. You respond with a standing salute.

(super leader is less)

As they exit, Sergeant Bayer whispers in your ear. "Agent, allow me to remind you of your loyalty. It's not to your superior, it is not to me, it is to the Ministry and the State. And, as far as I can tell, you have your priorities misplaced. I suggest you reconsider yours if you want to have a long career. Don't forget that."

(leader is less)

Sergeant Bayer leaves the interrogation room, with Lieutenant Bryce behind him. As soon as the sergeant exits the room, Lieutenant Bryce closes the door and faces you, looking at you like a frog he is about to dissect. "If I didn't know any better," he growls. "I'd say you are deliberately attempting to go over your superior officer. We have a way we do things in this Ministry, Agent Brownie. If a random Otto off the street is a threat to national security, he is. If a shoplifter is simply a boy in an errand, the shopkeep is happy to have served his state. We do as we are told. I do, and so must you if you want to have a long career. Don't forget that." 

(all same)

And with that, they leave. You are now completely alone. 


## Day 3

### Previous to questioning

As you take off your heavy headphones and prepare the desk for your night shift surveillance partner, you receive a phone call from the internal Ministry network. The voice on the other end is the same monotone that had preluded the interrogation from yesterday.

"Agent Designation: Eight-Red-Zero-Whiskey-One-Seven-One-Three. You are required to present yourself at once to Central for dossier review following every day of operation while on assignment. Authorization. Delta-Sierra-Charlie-Hotel. Review of dossier will be conducted by Operations managers. Confirm receipt."

You confirm, this time with a bit more venom in your words. Something inside you boils over, tossing, churning, and turning as the company car takes you to headquarters. You are reminded of the interrogation training you did back at the academy, how the very first interrogatory you went through pushed you to the very edge of your sanity. You were forced to relieve yourself in your pants as you sat with your hands under your legs, an officer of the Ministry grilling you, mocking you, taunting you with the name of your mother and your father. Of course, you knew they knew everything, and again, of course, you knew that this was just an exercise. A way of breaking recruits. But then as always a doubt on the back of your head asking the questions you dare not speak out loud:

"Was it necessary?"

"Was it right, what you were doing?"

"Was it right, what they did to you?"

Loud electronic chimes and screeching metal doors take you out of your own mind, again in the sam e room, again in front of Bryce, the very manifestation of a nicotine stain, and Bayer, a stone statue who quoted the rules like scripture. /n/n "Shall we begin, Agent, Lieutenant?" Bayer says, breaking the ice and motioning towards you to deliver the most recent surveillance notes. Bryce didn't respond. He just grunted his approval like he was sending away a waiter for getting his order wrong.

### 3.-- No evidence presented

You explain that, despite what the surveillance might suggest and the repeated insistence to the contrary, there was no evidence of malfeasance or wrongdoing on part of either Albert Hassel or Nadine Leitzka. Though they were quite argumentative, it simply did not seem that these people presented a threat to the security of the State, nor did they appear to act in such away that would imply that they take part in any subversive activity.

"Mark my words, Agent," Lieutenant Bryce says just above a whisper, "if by the time this investigation doesn't end I will see to it personally that you will be transferred."

Sergeant Bayer does a double take, surprised by this determination. "I have to say Lieutenant, that's not what I would expec-"

"No, Sergeant you misunderstand me." Lieutenant Bryce interrupts, savoring his words as they come out of his mouth. "Allow me to give you the full view of what is exactly what you are doing sabotaging this operation. At nine-hundred hours Monday last week we have a suspicious package appear in the perimeter of Waldsiedlung, we investigate it to find a dud bomb."

Sergeant Bayer tries to intervene yet again. "Lieutenant, you are releasing information that the Agent most likely has no clearance to hear!"

"Bayer, I am trying to salvage this operation and you cannot wait to set a criminal free! At the very least you will see to it that I give the criminal in front of us a good reason to keep his job and his life!" Lieutenant Bryce bellows. Sergeant Bayer tightens his fists and starts to redden in the face.

"A bomb was going to detonate in the innermost sanctum of our Party. Injure people, kill who many. The bomb has the makings of United Left, the organization that Hassel *is* a part of. So, I give you one last chance, Agent. You will shape up and demonstrate your usefulness to this organization or you will be processed for treason. You have no other options." Lieutenant Bryce says, looking to meet your gaze on every random eye movement you make.

You nod in agreement.

Sergeant Bayer takes a deep breath and relaxes his fists. "A -- frankly gross -- lapsus in classified information aside, your judgement is starting to come under questions Agent. You will report on the  next proceedings, or I will have to step aside and allow Lieutenant Bryce to make good on the threats he makes. As he is your superior immediate officer, this will be inevitable if you continue to act in this manner. Is that clear?"

You nod in agreement again.

### 3.1 Mystery Package is for Nadine (super leader +2 and leader +2)

You explain that the mystery package that was picked up by Hassel directly on his mailing box, the same package that inexplicably was not detected by Division XIX, was addressed to Nadine Leitzka. This arises further suspicion as, by Hassel's own admission, Leitzka had not officially notified any government about her current living arrangement despite cohabitating with Hassel for a period of time far superior than any given leeway for a long-form visit to a friend. At the very least, it meant Leitzka was guilty of omitting to report to her local constabulary or update her mailing records.

"So, it would appear that we may have a much more interesting situation with Ms. Leitzka than it was initially appraised." Lieutenant Bryce said, rubbing his chin after a brief moment of silence.

"I'll say," Sergeant Bayer responds, nodding. "Let's put aside how exactly how did this Leitzka receive this package without our knowledge. As the Agent said, the lack of a formal change of address from her is a lot more interesting. As far as where we are standing, Division XIX had no way of knowing to stop the packages going to that domicile from Hassel addressed to her."

"What do you mean Bayer?" Lieutenant Bryce asks with some impatience.

"Assuming that Division XIX has done their duty in a timely-" Sergeant Bayer begins.

"Again, assuming too much from those pencil pushes, Sergeant." Lieutenant Bryce raises his voice a bit more.

"Hold on please Lieutenant and let me finish." Sergeant Bayer turns to Lieutenant Bryce and knocks the table with his fist gently, but just so that it would still make a sharp noise. "Assuming that they have done their jobs correctly, which I believe they do, that package was not handled by them but by another third party that is not known to us."

"We have surveillance detail in that building, Sergeant, in case you have not noticed!" Lieutenant Bryce shouts as he waves the dossier papers around. "Are you suggesting that what were are doing is insufficient? Is that the accusation you are making? Simple explanations Bayer. Simple, explanations." /n/n He continues to gesticulate in the air, moving imaginary box things. "Is it really too far-fetched to expect our own systems to be infallible to let through one package, even if placed under a gag order? Have you know any entity within this Ministry or others to be completely blameless and without error?"

"Well now, Lieutenant Bryce we cannot start questioning over-" Again, Sergeant Bayer starts adopting that professorial tone as he was giving a lecture to you and the Lieutenant. 

But, Bryce is one of those rowdy children who won't sit still. "Have you?" He insists. "Or are you the one and only Otto out of a group of wretched snitches that never made a single mistake or misstep in his career?"

It's evident that the Sergeant's patience is being tested. He clenches his fists as he responds. "You know I am compelled by the Party to say yes."

"There it is then, clear as day." The Lieutenant said, triumphant and arrogant. "This a simple mistake by a Division having to screen the mail for an entire country, our country. That the package requires investigation, I have no doubt." 

"Neither do I." Sergeant Bayer murmurs.

"But, proper framing is required, after all." Lieutenant Bryce says as he jots it down. "We might actually find something not that important."

(If 2.6 was accepted)

(You were astonished to see what had just happened: Not only that those two were in complete agreement, but that Lieutenant Bryce could spin on a pinhead at a moment's notice. It was almost magical. You were looking for such a reaction in Sergeant Bayer's face, but he looked like a freshly carved stone statue.)

[Argue for a clerical mistake in Division XIX]

Lieutenant Bryce jots notes down. "Well, well," he says. "I think it would be best to investigate the matter internally, we can't afford rookie mistakes on the operations of this Ministry." Sergeant Bayer crosses his hands, and looks off to the side so as to say nothing.

(Leader +2)

[Argue for a third party dropping packages in Hassel's mailbox]

(Superleader + 2)

"It's a shame that we cannot afford to record much on tape, much less for video feeds." Sergeant Bayer say, gesticulating in the air as he did. "We would be able to see who exactly made this drop and they be identified. For now, we'll have to shelve that part of the story, and make a note to investigate it in its own time."

Lieutenant Bryce tuts at this suggestion. "Might I suggest a trip to the psychiatrist, since making things up and having hunches seems now your standard surveillance repertoire, Bayer." /n/n "If you had more imagination you'd be my superior three times over, Bryce." Bayer responds with a certain amount of spite. "There are more factors at play Lieutenant, you'd do best to identify them in a matter of national security." He responded, his words ballooned with arrogance.

### 3.2 Missed Phone Call (super leader -1 or leader -1)

You share that a phone call coming out of Hassel's flat was unfortunately left unrecorded because you were otherwise occupied with the local Party office to hold Albert Hassel off for an unspecified period of time.

Both of the men in front of you have a shocked looked on their faces. Sergeant Bayer scratches his forehead and shakes his head. Lieutenant Bryce raps his fingers on the metal table, mouthing to himself something you can't quite hear.

"Agent," Lieutenant Bryce asks with a distinct annoyance, breaking the uneasy silence. "May I ask what exactly did you expect showing this to us? Honestly, I'd rather you'd never mentioned it at all."

"Belay that, Lieutenant," Sergeant Bayer says, motioning towards Bryce. "I commend your honesty, Agent. Believe me, I do. But that doesn't excuse your sheer incompetence at this level of Ministry work."

Lieutenant Bryce lets go of a cackling laugh that resonates in your skull, sounding like a serrating log. That laugh could send chills down the spine of the best covert agent. In between the gasps of laughter he ekes out his words. /n/n  "Your temerity is astounding, Agent. Truly."

He composes himself before he points the finger at you and growls. "I should perhaps ask your mother if you grassed on your friends when you were little, you're so stupid."

Sergeant Bayer turns in disbelief at Bryce and shouts, scandalized. "Can it, Bryce!" He then turns to you. "Please don't waste our time anymore, Agent. What is it that you want to do with this dud?"

[You take the script piece of paper and you rip it to shreds.]

You see Sergeant Bayer's face turn and twist into an ugly visage. "What are you doing Agent?! That is state property you are destroying! It' s part of an ongoing investigation, and official state document! I should give you a formal writ of reprimand for this insolence!" He hollers, red in the face. Lieutenant Bryce just looks at him and smirks, then back at you and smirks again. It's like there was some kind of game, and he just won.

(Lambda super leader -1)

[You insist that it must remain on record, embarrassing as it is.]

Lieutenant Bryce purses his lips, and throws the papers he was manhandling on the table. "Suppose you want to file the wrapping paper of the sandwich you ate today, lest it not be stricken from the record and occupy the infinite time we have to review your terrible handiwork." He says, leaning heavily on his mocking tone of voice. Sergeant Bayer shrugs, and motions to move onto the next thing of the agenda.

(Lambda leader -1)

### 3.3 Unfamiliar person to investigation was not in surveillance (super leader +2 and leader -1, no argument needed, passthrough)

You present evidence of a third party hitherto unknown and unrecorded on the dossier files previous or during the investigation, known only as Sonia. This person comes into Albert Hassel's flat, is known to Nadine Leitzka, and does so at a moment of high distress for Leitzka. For as little you know about Leitzka, a new person that the Ministry had no prior knowledge of is important to discuss.

Sergeant Bayer looks at Lieutenant Bryce with a puzzled look, as if he was trying to test his mettle in a staring contest. Lieutenant Bryce doesn't seem to be pleased. You seem him shrug and make a crumpled grimace. 

"Are you sure we're not surveilling the wrong person, Lieutenant?" Sergeant Bayer asks. "Because this Leitzka of yours -- that you assure this investigative committee is of no importance, by the by -- is like a box of unpleasant, unrecorded surprises one after the other."

Lieutenant Bryce makes some kind of face at the Sergeant, showing his yellow teeth as if he were a growling dog. "I have to admit this "Sonia" character is quite interesting, wouldn't you agree, Sergeant Bayer?" He says, barely above a whisper.

"No, Lieutenant. You will answer my question." Sergeant Bayer says, firmly and with the slightest tinge of anger. "Is this "Sonia" somewhere in Leitzka's file that you simply elected not to share with the investigation?"

Lieutenant Bryce raises his voice, and looks at the ground as he speaks. "I wrote all into information I had on the citize-"

"I find that very hard to believe." Sergeant Bayer interjects, raising his voice just above Lieutenant Bryce. He ups the ante on his annoyance. "We are the Ministry of State Security. The Sword and Shield of the State."

"Oh you're going to quote party doctrine to me, like that is going to magically improve the intel, huh Bayer?" Lieutenant Bryce responds, letting out a nasty nasal tone as he did.

"You misunderstand me, Lieutenant Bryce." Sergeant Bryce says, raising his voice yet again to what you could call a low shout. "This ministry by its very nature must have eyes and ears, everywhere. And it has. We know everything because for this Nation to survive the blasted enemy at our gates and in our lands we MUST know everything." 

Sergeant Bayer takes a deep breath to continue his sermon. "And now... Now! Now I find out that we have a massive blindspot. A memory hole where all information goes to die, and its name is Nadine Leitzka. And to my endless luck and fortune, we have just stumbled upon her!" /n/n He chuckles before continuing. "I find that hard to believe. Very, very hard indee-"

Lieutenant Bryce shakes his head violently and smashes his fist on the metal table. "And your point is, Sergeant Bayer!?" He snarls.

"Oh! Oh, my point? You want to know my point?" Sergeant Bayer responds, mocking with the same nasally tone that the Lieutenant adopted. "Oh you are going to *love* it! I don't think she is a blindspot at all. I think someone has protected this woman within our organization and using our resources to do so, and I will start asking who and why! And I'll start with you, Lieutenant Bryce!"

Lieutenant Bryce stands up, clenching his fists. His face reddens with anger. "Prove your accusations or so help me-"

Sergeant Bayer stands up from his chair too. He towers over you and Bryce, like an ancient monolith. "You'll do what, exactly?" He taunts. "Sabotage us further? I think you'll find it hard to do in a room with no windows and four walls closing in."

"Damn you Bayer!" Lieutenant Bryce shouts, enraged, before turning towards you and directing his anger at you. "And damn you too, Agent Brownie! If I am to be reprimanded, you will too, you pencil-necked imbecile."

Sergeant Bryce snaps his fingers. He does this so loudly, it forces you to sit up and pay attention. It shook up Bryce before he continued to enumerate the ways you had just screwed yourself over in the process of doing your job. "No, no Lieutenant Bryce." He says in his professional, lecturing manner. "The Agent's duty is to report, which he has done gallantly. Yours, on the other hand, is to fall on your sword if our apparatus deems it necessary for it's continued survival. Any more expletives from you and you'll be on the other side of that desk, Lieutenant."

Filled with anger, and no words to convey it, Lieutenant Bryce sits down and growls like a dog that just got punished. He looks at you, and seeks your eyes when you avert them, daring you to look back. Sergeant Bryce takes his seat, draws in a deep breath, and shuffles the papers in front of him. He motions to continue the conversation and go no further.

 (super leader +2 and leader -1, no argument needed, passthrough)

### 3.4 Evasive "Sonia" (super leader -1 and leader +2) 

You discuss the conversations that this person, Sonia, had with Nadine Leitzka. The content of the conversation was cryptic, as was the way she carried herself. She spoke in code, and would probably not be noticed had it not for the surveillance apparatus that was watching her acquaintance. If Leitzka was mysterious, she was doubly so. Sonia was probably an alias, and that was enough grounds for suspicion.

Sergeant Bayer looked at the case file and looked at it backwards and forwards, as if he was trying to get the last chocolate out of the box. "I'm not quite comfortable with the idea that a person that is relevant to this investigation is not a character we could readily identify with the existing camera setup." He stops manhandling the notes and looks directly at you with leery eyes. "As I understand it, she was covered from head to toe, no? I think that is quite suspicious, to conduct oneself in that manner..."

Lieutenant Bryce shrugged, with his yellowish grin. "Or maybe she is cold?" He quipped.

Sergeant Bayer furrowed his brow, he almost seemed offended by that insinuation. "She was cold, that was the best you could come up with, Lieutenant Bryce?"

Bryce scoffs, he's behaving like a teenage girl who is getting the business from her father. "Bryce, what was the average temperature outside today, during the day?"

Sergeant Bryce lets out a chuckle, but not a pleasant one. "Is this a trick question, Lieutenant?"

"C'mon Bayer, humor me. Take a guess." Lieutenant Bryce responds.

"I'd say... seven degrees? Maybe?" Sergeant Bryce responds with tremendous incredulity.

Lieutenant Bryce slaps the handles of his chair and motions towards the Sergeant with an uncanny amount of confidence. "There's you answer, Sergeant! It was seven degrees outside. She is cold, Bayer! It's the start of March, for the love of God. This character is simply sensitive to cold and we are supposed to jump on her for dressing the part?" He cackles before continuing to admonish the Sergeant's paranoia. "I'd be dressed like that too if I expected to be out and about. I'd suggest you start worrying about relevant evidence."

Sergeant Bayer shakes his head, showing his teeth as he does. You can't really tell if he's smiling or gritting his teeth. "You know, that's quite rich coming from you, so renowned by your patience. And your prudence. And, lest we forget, your pragmatism." 

The sarcasm of Sergeant Bayer goes over like a lead balloon in a thunderstorm. Lieutenant Bryce crosses his arms and defies his superior. "Oh, is that so?" He responds with an accusatory snarl.

"Oh, absolutely." Sergeant Bayer responds, relishing the verbal fencing. "Only insofar if you consider a cudgel to the head a pragmatic solution, Lieutenant Bryce.

Lieutenant Bryce lets out a loud, raspy cackle that just might be the worst thing you have ever heard. It made nails on a chalkboard sound like Beethoven.  "I'm more surprised you don't agree with me, Sergeant." He says in between wheezes.

The Sergeant scratches his chin, posing as if he was thinking intensely. The debate is starting to devolve into a childish spat, with all this snide commentary. "Well... let's start with the fact that she is an unknown to our intel." He starts in his professorial tone. "That alone is grounds for suspicion and prime material for a formal inquiry."

Lieutenant Bryce clicks his mouth. "Tsk, tsk, tsk" he says. " now who is misusing Ministry resources, eh?" /n/n Sergeant Bayer inches closer to Bryce's face, seeking his gaze wherever it would be pointed at. "Right, if you don't pursue this the judgement to be doubted is not going to be mine but yours. I'd rather you not risk your career on dismissing a suspect because you think they're cold. "

The Lieutenant calls the Sergeant's bluff and bashes his forehead against Sergeant Bryce's wide face. He is taken aback by this gesture and flinches, returning to his seat. "Oh piss off." You hear him mouth barely above a whisper.

[Say nothing and stare at Bryce]

You decide to stay silent and look at Bryce for guidance. The Lieutenant grabs the folio with the report about Sonia, folds it ups, and stores it in his coat pocket.  He gives you a complicit gang and puts on his best smiling face. "Well if the Sergeant says so, then we'll do it! We'll pursue this lead and see if the Ministry has any materials." Sergeant Bayer nods, satisfied with this answer. Though, the unspoken reality between the three of you is quite different. Bayer looks at you with a certain degree of contempt.

(Super leader -1 and leader +2)

[Insist on keeping it on the record.]

You speak up, and slide the folio towards Bayer. A lead is a lead and we should follow all of them. Sergeant Bayer looks at the piece of paper, and pauses for a moment. "Is this the only copy there is of this piece of evidence, Agent?" You nod. "Well, that won't do for records and investigations." He says, folding it and giving it to Bryce, who up until now was looking you as if you were a small gazelle and he a big lion. "Lieutenant Bryce, you may assign another agent to the task of looking into this Sonia, in the mean time we'll have to do with the Agent's notes." The Lieutenant receives it, hesitant about what to do next. He then flashes a devilish grin, nods, and then puts it in his breast pocket.

(Nothing)

### 3.5 Description of "Sonia" (super leader +2 or leader +2)

### 3.6 Pleasantries with the neighbor (super leader +2 and leader -1 )

You explain that Albert Hassel had decided to talk to the neighbor before entering his own flat, something that he had not done previously. This conversation was unrecorded and undocumented, given that there was no indication that he would have any sort of interest in his neighbors in the file. This needs to be entered into the surveillance dossier as an interaction that could have adverse effects if the identity of the other person is not known.

"Do we have the list of tenants on file, Agent?" Sergeant Bayer asks. You produce the list of tenants in Hassel's building. The apartment number and description match citizen Laurie Weiss.

"She seemed to have a connection with Nadine Leitzka. I believe this would require a cursory inquiry on her character and information, but nothing more." Sergeant Bayer says, in that kind of tone that says that the conversation should move on.

The Lieutenant disagreed. "Oh, Bayer. Bayer. I don't think that is necessary."

Sergeant Bayer looks sideways at the Lieutenant. "You do the job well or you don't do it at all, Lieutenant Bryce." He says with a heavy sigh. "Agent, please order that inqui-."

"No, no." Lieutenant Bryce intervenes, gesticulating with his hands something fierce. "Agent, belay that order. I will determine what is relevant in this investigation. This has one target and one target alone and his name, lest you forget Sergeant, is Albert Hassel!"

"And his associates, Lieutenant Bryce." The Sergeant responds, raising his voice. "Surely you can't be so green you'd think they were blameless."

"Sergeant, we must focus!" Lieutenant Bryce shouts, slamming his finger on the dossier he held.

[Vocally support Sergeant Bayer]

You speak up, citing Ministry rulebooks and regulations that compel you to report and follow up with any unknown associates. Sergeant Bayer smiles triumphantly. "The kid is quoting the book at you now, Lieutenant Bryce. I should be more diligent lest you take his position and him yours." He says with a guffaw. Lieutenant Bryce responds, while looking directly in your eyes. You'd think he was trying to make your eyeballs boil with thought alone. "I wouldn't be so surprised if Agent Brownie here was so inclined to become a pencil-pushing lump of coal too."

(super leader +2 and leader -1 )

[You say nothing]

You decide to stay quiet, and the pair of squabbling men to their own argument. It had been just about the 9th time you'd hear this argument between your two superiors. It was becoming old hat, quickly. You'd wonder if they would ever agree on anything. You wonder if they were enjoying fighting each other. You wonder if they continued these interrogations simply because the had enough misery for themselves so they had to spread some around. 

(nothing)

### Conclusion

The men get up from their seats and, as before, you respond with a standing salute. Though the gesture is becoming more and more empty by the minute. Some rotten job this is. 

Before any of them can talk to you as they did yesterday, you bolt out of these with a brisk walk. You can feel them stare at you as you walk away from them as fast as your legs can take you without sprinting.

Every evening you spend with these two it feels like something slides in between your skin and your flesh. Something that doesn't let you breathe or sweat, that dulls your senses. It feels like a shrink wrap pressing on your eyes, mouth, and ears. Not nearly enough to suffocate you, but getting to it slowly.

Every door on the hallways comprising the interrogation room block have these little rectangular windows with a fine mesh over them. They let the air in but they don't allow people to look from the outside in, nor the other way around. Calling them windows is, therefore, a mistake. They're vents. 

Little pinprick points that look like beady bug eyes on the walls. Everywhere, and anywhere.

## Day 4

### Previous to questioning



### 4.-- No evidence presented



### 4.1 Mystery Package was passed through (super leader +x and leader -1 no argument needed passthrough)

You report that the veto on file that was supposed to stop the mystery package from arriving in Albert Hassel's mailbox did not exist in time when the surveillance operation officially started. The only explanation is that the veto was either not filled on time, or it was ignored deliberately, or it was an accidental mishap. Either way, this was an official breach of protocol that you needed to report immediately. 

The silence between the two men in front of you refuses to go away. Every time you try to speak up it's as if there was an angel of death sitting behind you, daring to emit a single sound to make her scythe swing around your neck. You observe Sergeant Bayer balling the papers into his tight fist. You can see his knuckles go white and his finger tips redden with the strength of his grip. Lieutenant Bryce stares into the ceiling, transfixed by God knows what. He rocks back and forth, restless. 

You don't really know what to make of it or how to move forward. You'd love to grab the sheaf of yellow and white paper, and move on to the next clue, you'd love to bolt out of there, you'd love for some kind of cataclysm to make a hole above you and take you in a whirlwind. Anything to get out of this maniacal sound.

Lieutenant Bryce, begins to speak with a caution you have never seen in the man. "W-w-well Agent. I think you are mistaking the interrogation with your own writing circle. I'd be more impressed with this attempt to be the department's own Hercule Poirot if it wasn't on Ministry time and resources."

Sergeant Bayer turns his head, slowly, towards the hirsute, bald man that is Lieutenant Bryce. He looks like a stone lion sentinel, like those guarding the Gate. Stoic, and yet somehow you can feel the repressed, unbridled rage inside him. "That's your conclusion, Bryce?" He asks. 

"Sergeant, you cannot possibly accept this state-"

"What I believe, Lieutenant." He says, raising his voice to interrupt and impose on Lieutenant Bryce. "Is that a highly detailed explanation, spanning a couple of days to reveal itself to us, makes you responsible for a breach in protocol. And I am waiting for a better justification than 'he made it up'. So, Bryce, what is it?"

Lieutenant Bryce scoffs and stars gesticulating with his hands, getting redder and redder in the face. "What would you have me do, Bayer?" He shouts. "I suppose you'd love to have me fall to my knees on the floor and grovel to pay for other people's sins, you pencil-necked desk jockey!"

Hearing this insult, Sergeant Bayer stands up and motions towards his firearm on his right hand-side. "Lieutenant, I am warning--" he starts to say with a lot more palpable rage in his voice.

"Warn me all you want, Bayer." The Lieutenant responds. "I refuse to take any responsibility for a mistake I did not cause." He leans on those last few words, enunciating every vowel. Both men are standing in front of each other, ready and able to tear each other's head off, and you were there to see the bloody spectacle.

"Oh so they are mistakes now, Bryce?" The Sergeant says defiantly. "Now that there's no explanation we're just calling this gross dereliction of duty a mistake?"

"I should be the one grilling you, Sergeant." Lieutenant Bryce swings at the Sergeant's hand trained on his weapon. He wasn't expecting that. He flinches and motions away to keep the gun away from Sergeant Bayer's hand. "If I'm shouldering the blame, you are rolling in the mud with me too."

"You wish you insubordinate oaf." Sergeant Bayer snarls back. "This operation was hour idea, your brilliant plan to pull all the levers and favors you could get to put a body in front a press camera. The body of the most ordinary factory worker in the German Democratic Republic. If it were up to you, Albert Hassel would be eating gruel, blindfolded in a prison cell no larger than a coffin." He takes a few steps back and breaths deeply before continuing. Wrath continues to pour out of him.

"As it happens, comrade, it's my job to get in the way of people like your ilk, Bryce. The Ministry is not your personal army, and I will see to it that after all is said and done, you face a jury. And I will personally make a point to that you cannot walk away from this instance of gross incompetence."

Bryce, speechless, looks at you as if he's about to lunge past the edge of the table and crush your skull in a  single bite.

Sergeant Bayer motions towards you, a bit calmer than he was 10 seconds ago. "Flawed as it is, " he reassures you. 'We have an operation to conclude and people to process. Please, Agent, proceed for the next item in the agenda.'

### 4.2 Leitzka leaves without telling anyone where (super leader -1 and leader +x)

You note that, by Albert Hassel's own admission, Leitzka went out on regular outings with a destination unknown to him. Given that she hasn't gone out at all during surveillance, and the dearth of evidence on Nadine Leitzka, you'll have to trust that he is at least telling the truth about this particular detail. Given the circumstances, her absences raise questions about who does she meet, and where. 

Lieutenant Bryce leans forward, in what you guess is his attempt to be assertive rather than imposing. "I might not seem like it, gentlemen. But, I believe that the women of this State deserve all our protection. I believe that, while the original objective of this investigation is determining whether or not Mr. Hassel is a subversive agent with the designs to usurp our democracy, securing the safety of Ms. Leitzka has become a priority of ours that is compatible with our larger objectives."

Sergeant Bayer widens his eyes, and looks towards the Lieutenant with a wry little smirk on his face. "And, how do you reach that conclusion, Bryce?" He says, in a light, airy tone that just layers on the sarcasm.

"Do you not see it?" Lieutenant Bryce chides as he slams finger on the piece of paper that you produced for this occasion. "Does the behavior of this woman describes a person who enjoys the company of Albert Hassel? You might want to ask yourself that."

Sergeant Bayer, shrugs, his face stuck on that smarmy grimace. "If anything, I'd say that should cast a bigger cloud of suspicion over her, Bryce. This woman goes out of her way to hide herself such that the information we have on her is notable for its scarcity. And yet, here you are, telling us we should give her more rope?"

Lieutenant Bryce waves his hands even more frantically, desperately trying to win the argument. "This is a woman looking for an escape, Sergeant Bayer. Frankly, I'm not surprised that something that requires a level of tact above a goldfish is lost on you."

"So, we are meant to look over the fact that this woman could and would avail herself to the services we provide for individual housing? She cannot be ignorant about them." Sergeant Bayer responds with some annoyance in his voice.

The Lieutenant slams the papers on the desk. "And yet, she chooses otherwise! What a calamity!" He cries. He covers his face with his hands, gathering himself a bit before continuing. Odd, you've not seen him do that ever. "People are not machines, Sergeant." He says. "I think such excursions fit a pattern of behavior we have covered before."

Sergeant Bayer grabs the papers Lieutenant Bryce left on the table and waves them around, imitating Bryce's gesticulations. "Why are we talking about this individual if not for the fact that she is suspect of subversive behavior?!" He roars. "If we must talk about patterns of behavior, I'd say that it's obvious she is hiding something of interest to this investigation!"

Lieutenant Bryce isn't having it. He cross his arms and leans back on his chair. "And it is my position, Sergeant, that this woman needs our help and she would be better served away from Hassel and his corrupting influence. Something that we are already doing as they are both in isolation in this very building." He says, a bit more triumphant than warranted.

[You say that Hassel should take priority in questioning, as he is the target of the investigation ]

Lieutenant Bryce slaps his thighs and motions towards you. "See? Even the Agent knows his priorities. We need to look at what that man has to say, and consider ourselves lucky we have another case to pursue once this one is done." Sergeant Bayer is not impressed, and by the way he looks at you he is quite disappointed.

(super leader -1 and leader +1)

[You say nothing]

You leave the Lieutenant and the Sergeant to have their own little standoff and argue it out. You tune it out. You look at the picture of Nadine Leitzka, the only one the Ministry has on her file. 

What is she?

 Who is she? 

What could she be trying to accomplish? 

...

The Sergeant clears his throat, calling for your attention. You look up, and hurriedly bring the next item of the agenda to their attention.

### 4.3 Hassel did not report Leitzka (super leader +x and leader -1 OR super leader -1 and leader +x)

You report on two statements that, if true, need immediate attention. One, that the owner of the state-restricted literature is indeed Ms. Leitzka. Two, that she had in her possession additional literature, in this case pamphlets, that Albert Hassel himself deemed inappropriate and worthy of reporting to the State authority. This raises all kinds of red flags since it is clear that Nadine Leitzka is at the very least, in contact with subversive groups that are the subject of the investigation itself.

The Sergeant takes the stuffed folder where you have been keeping all your evidence and begins to lay down yellow folio pages and photo stock squares on the metal table.

(If Nadine's Family Picture) You observe a picture of a picture, a child being held by her mother.

(If Sonia) You observe the description of the mystery woman that crashed into the investigation like a deer crossing the road.

(If Mystery Package was passed through) You see the long litany of memos, signed forms, and inquiriesbabout that blasted package.

(If Lietzka leaves) You see a written account of the threats Nadine Leitzka made a few hours ago.

He lays them all out, one next to the other, in rows. The Lieutenant, who had been seeing this labor unfold in silence, finally pipes up. "May I ask what is all this business?" The Sergeant ignores him, and lays down the last few of the papers.

"Do you see it, Lieutenant?" The Sergeant says, motioning towards his work forcefully. "I don't have time for games, and neither does the State." Lieutenant Bryce snarls back.

"Well, I'd say it's rather obvious!" Sergeant Bayer bellows. "We have a book. Now we have pamphlets. Both owned by this Nadine Leitzka. Have I got it correctly, Agent?" He asks you. 

(If you have evidence for Wealth of Nation) You agree empathically.

(If you don't have evidence for Wealth of Nations) You stare at the Sergeant, not quite knowing what he means.

"Moreover," The Sergeant continues. "Mr. Hassel should have informed us, by his own admission of the existence and content of these pamphlets. Does that have anything to do with a strained relationship? I'd say it does, and I'd love to know why, then, are we prosecuting the wrong person?"

Lieutenant Bayer's face reddens. In anger, he bangs his fists on the table, scattering the papers on it. "For the hundredth time, Bayer, that's not what the intel has told us before!"

"The intel we are getting now disproves that, Lieutenant." Sergeant Bayer snaps. "I don't know how, even for you, it's not crystal clear."

"Hassel is forcing Leitzka to be there against her will!" Lieutenant Bryce says, as he produces the picture of Albert Hassel from the dossier. He jabs his finger on Hassel's face. "Do you see this enlarged mouse of a man truly being able to satisfy the whims of this female character?"

Sergeant Bayer becomes silent. He scrunches his face and crosses his arms. "I'm sorry, I must have blanked out for ten seconds. What does Mr. Hassel's appearance have to do with the purposes of our investigation?" He chides.

"Coercion, Bayer! Coercion!" Lieutenant Bryce exclaims, throwing his hands up in the air. "This woman has not demonstrated any thought to call her own and now she's some sort of criminal mastermind out to destroy the country!"

The Sergeant grabs Hassel's picture from Bryce's hands and points at him. "By that logic, this enlarged mouse, as you have decided to call him, should be just as inoffensive. I do not see you extending Albert Hassel the same benefit."

Lieutenant Bryce mutters something under his breath. Sergeant Bryce is even more confused, and commands. "Lieutenant for the love of God speak up, we-"

"He doesn't deserve it!" Lieutenant Bryce shouts.

"On what possible grounds?!" Sergeant Bayer roars, his annoyance hovering just below the boiling point.

"That he is suspected of-" Lieutenant Bryce begins, before being cut off by his superior. "On what grounds do you make the accusation, Lieutenant?!"

"The intel consists of intercepted mail from a known location of the subversive movement United Left, Sergeant." Bryce says before motioning towards you. "This was under the Agent's clearance level, but clearly you have other ideas, Bayer." 

The Sergeant turns his back and stands facing the wall, tapping his foot. "The mail?" He asks. 

"Yes, Bayer. The mail." Lieutenant Bryce responds matter-of-factly.

"We are here, having detained two citizens of this republic without even a small violation to their names, because of the mail. And we started this process, because of the blasted mail." He says, in that kind of tone that precedes something terrible.

"It was good enough for men bigger than you, Bayer!" Lieutenant Bryce snarls. "It should be good enough for you too!"

Sergeant Bayer turns around, stroking the handle of his pistol as he did. You are taken aback for a few seconds. You fully expected him to unfurl it and discharge from the way he wore that crazed face. "That is inexcusable, Lieutenant. And rest assured I will make a note of this." He whispers.

Lieutenant Bryce scoffs, and breaks out into a mad cackle. "And? Send me to jail then, for being overzealous! For being a stalwart part of the protection of this state! Go on! I dare you!" He spits at Bayer's feet. "You'll soon find out just how much actual power you have in this organization."

Sergeant Bayer in one sweeping unholsters his pistol, cuts the cartridge, and trains it directly at Bryce's forehead. You jump, and motion towards the door by pure reflex. Lieutenant Bryce is surprised and frozen in place, transfixed on the firearm pointing at him.  "Right here, I have enough power to stop men like you, Bryce."

The tension in the room could smother a sperm whale. Lieutenant Bryce switch rapidly between looking at the nose-end of Sergeant Bayer's Makarov and back at his face. His gun, then back at him. His gun, then back at him. Seconds elongated into decades.

Slowly, the Lieutenant relaxed his posture and assumed a more submissive demeanor without taking his eyes off the weapon. As he did the Sergeant relaxed his grip on the gun, and lowered his trigger finger back to the grip. "You have rebuffed protocols, guidelines, rulebooks, and laws at every turn. It surprises me you have lasted in this organization for any period of time that's not half a day." He says. 

Sergeant Bayer lowers his gun, and his gun and sits back on his chair, without breaking eye contact with Bryce who was still standing. He stares back, motioning towards his empty chair with a great deal of caution. The Sergeant motions at him with the pistol still in his hand, beckoning him to sit.

Lieutenant Bayer grips the back rest of his chair and drags it slowly across the room, making that unpleasant screeching sound of steel scraping on concrete. He stops and sits away from you and the Sergeant, in the middle of one of the long edges of the table.

There's a brief moment of silence before someone speaks, and it's Lieutenant Bryce who does it. "You are assuming, Sergeant, that the book belongs to Nadine Leitzka. I think that assumption is incorrect based on the evidence." He says with a much slower speed and tone. 

"And?" The Sergeant asks, holstering his gun back in his waist. "What evidence would that be? It's clear from Ms. Lietzka's words that it's hers."

"Sergeant, you can't keep ignoring evidence when it doesn't suit you." The Lieutenant insists. "Hassel has referred to the book's contents before today, he is at least guilty of reading that book."

"And he is guilty of it and will be processed for it in due time, Lieutenant." The Sergeant responds with a nod. "That doesn't make him an operative of a subversive group that is a threat to our national security. Ms. Leitzka is not blameless either. She hid that thing, and did not report it to the local constable."

"Must have been as his direction, Sergeant. There's more than one way to skin this cat." Lieutenant says, his usual annoyance returning to his breath. "Now now, who is making assumptions now?" Sergeant Bayer says as he gesticulates with his hands some sort of dismissive gesture.

Lieutenant Bryce stretches to get the full dossier, and pulls out sheafs of paper that you recognize. This is your handiwork, typewritten accounts of the conversations that Leitzka and Hassel had had for the past four days. He waves the transcripts around like it was some kind of big revelation.

"What I can read, and what we can read for that matter,"  Bryce says. "Is for all her high-flying theatrics and defiant attitude, this woman has not had one original thought and follows Hassel around like a lapdog."

Sergeant Bayer is visibly taken a back by this statement. "Meaning?" He asks with genuine curiosity.

"If she refers to some objects as her book, her pamphlets, I am not one hundred percent of the mind that the material she refers to is the anti-state literature that we are looking for."

Sergeant Bayer slaps his hand against his face, and sighs heavily as he shakes his head. "I find that hard to believe, for you and for this woman." He hisses.

"And, I find your inability to understand people as anything but mindless automatons, Sergeant, just as baffling." Lieutenant Bryce says with that little juvenile smirk. His bravado seems to have come back to him.

Unsatisfied, both men stew in their own frustration and anger, unable to convince each other of their own point of view.

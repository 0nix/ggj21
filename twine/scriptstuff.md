You arrive to the surveillance site, a five-story building in Fredericksville, surprinsgly a short distance from Headquarters. Gray, blocky, with a few blotches of colors in the windows produced by the occupants there in. Room 6 is the field office. On paper, it's where a pensioner woman resides. A lifetime of service to the Party has given her free lodgings, free food, free everything. As long as she keeps to all of ten square meters and the rest of the house functions as an outpost for Division XIX. At least she gets something out of all this mess.

You hand in your signed permission and you are led to a dark room lit only by the glow of the monitors and the blinking lights of recording equipment. A desk illuminated by cathode-ray-tube, long reel recorders, and a standard issue Ministry of State Security pair of headphones that could masticate your entire head if they were alive.

The two bedroom flat is located a few floors above you, and is fitted with two cameras, the kitchen and the living room. The phone line bugs are active, as is standard issue ten-milimeter microphones dotted in every room. This was a rush job from the look of things, just a few rungs above normal citizen surveillance: No new cameras, which meant that at least one occupant constantly remained in the house. Not odd for a housewife, however to your knowledge Ms. Leitzka was not married to Mr. Hassler.

Your long watch begins now, as you sit down on the metal chair provided to you, and, by the light of television, you lay in wait to observe and record.

Observe and record. The Shield and Sword of the State.

#### Day 1

Surveillance starts at 1500 hours on a Tuesday, March 9th.

You observe Nadine Leitzka, washing dishes in the kitchen. She hums a tune you can't quite make through the microphone and the noise of the rushing water.

You observe Ms. Leitzka opening the fridge to produce two baked hams and proceeds to cut slices from them, preparing food. <- Of note, normal rationing coupons for citizens such as Leitzka and Hassel ditctate that they have one smoked ham a month from the Food Stipend program for current able-bodided workers. You have no record of Letizka being employed, so that is one ham that is not accounted for.

You observe Ms. Leitzka turn on the radio and start drinking coffee, Cuban.

You observe Ms. Leitzka leave the kitchen and go into the hallway where there are no cameras to continue surveillance, analysis of the noises from audio match normal bathroom bodily activities. Audio analysis is difficult due to the sound of the radio drowning out the unseen activity.

Ms. Leitzka continues to be away from camera view, presumably having left the bathroom and stay in one of the two bedrooms of the residence. Audio analysis is inconclusive as to what she is doing, again, due to the sound of the radio in the kitchen. <- Common activity of citizens, whether on direct surveillance or not is to attempt to drown out their noises beneath the sounds of radio and television. This practice could be of note on a subject for subversion.

The door opens on the camera feed pointing to the living room, in comes a male individual, presumably Mr. Hassel. "Albert?" Leitzka asks from a room that is not in view of the surveillance equipment. "Yes Nadine, it's me." the man answers. Confirmed the individual to be Albert Hassel.

You observe Hassel greet Lietzka, take his coat off and leave it by one of two sofas in the living room. <- This is non-standard, however Hassel's dossier does denote that he did buy off a certain cadre of items from a friend who moved away to [REDACTED] on assignment. One of these items might be the sofa.

You observe Hassel sit on the sofa, relaxing his belt buckle. "Could you turn that thing off, Nadine? I grow tired of the same shrill voice saying the same things over and over." Lietzka complies, and turns the radio off. Audio analysis is no longer a challenge. <- Manifest dislike of newscaster is a small but concrete sign of seditious thoughts from Hassel.

"So," Lietzka inquires. "Have you gotten anything back from State Security? You know, for the exit visas?" 

"Ugh," Hassel grunts. "No, let's not talk about that right now Nadine. I have had enough with Gerhart's prodding and pulling and all these-- these little grubby things that get in the way of accomplishing anything in a single day of work." Lietzka stands by the kitchen door, arms crossed and clearly not satisfied with Hassel's answer. After a brief moment of silence, Lietzka storms off to the kitchen, throws the meal on a standard issue porcelain plate, then comes back to the living room and slams it in front of Hassel on the living room table. The noise is very sharp and stings to hear.

"Could you have a tantrum with your own belongings, Nadine? You know, instead of mine?" Hassel chides, as he grabs the plate and a fork to eat.

"I don't believe I asked you about that grubby boss of yours, Albert. I don't want to think about that man's smell of week-old tobacco." Leitzka snarls back. "I am asking about exit visas, for you, and me. I have been asking for exit visas for three months now. Laurie from a floor above only had to wait for a month, Albert. Quite frankly I don't understand why am I more upset than you, since the Ministry is clearly interrogating your... kindergarden teacher or something."

Hassel sighs in exasperation, and speaks in between chews. "Look, I don't know what to tell you. I have gone to my nearest State Security Office, you know, the one by the movie theater?" Lietzka nods in agreement. "Been going three times a day since I put in the papers to get exit visas. The man at the door already knows me by name, for God's sake. And it's always the same answer, no matter what."

"Your petition is currently being reviewed by Security authorities, an ongoing petition is not a subsitute for a visa." Nadine recites as if out of a prayer book.

"Guess what the putz at State Security told me this time?" Hassel says, with a tone of exasperation. "Go on, guess! I'll tell you what he didn't tell me, he did not say 'My apologies sir, here are your exit visas and as an apology for making you wait let hand feed you beluga caviar'!"

Leitzka rolls her eyes. "Go on keep shouting Albert," Leitzka reproaches "shout it loud and clear so that State Security 5 blocks over can clearly hear you. You never know who's listening, it maybe someone who will take criticism in stride!"

She pulls a chair from the kitchen to sit at a ninety-degree angle from Hassel. 

"I don't know what is with the Ministry," He says, finishing his plate. "I ask for something that I have a right to ask for. I have never done or said anything against doctrine. I attend every meeting of my local chapter, I am a volunteer tutor for the school... I may not be a chipper beaver inside the Party, but I haven't done anything wrong either! Security's just run by a nut job. As it always has." <- Subversive attitude against the State apparatus detected. 

"Don't lie, Albert." Leitzka says. "It's not every single Party meeting."

"Well, neither does the husband of this Laurie of yours. He's just a cousin of someone up in Border Troops high command. It's all the same everywhere, all the time. Some Party we got, eh." Hassel, says.

Leitzka mouths something that is not visible to the camera, nor loud enough to make out.

"Let's watch some T.V. Nadine. Ok?" Hassel says as you observe him reach out to Leitzka's shoulder, she recoils visibly from his touch but accepts his gesture. 

You observe both of them sit on the sofa and turn on the television set. They watch television in silence for the following two hours, without much to note or observe.

You observe Hassel break the silence. "I wish you'd tell me what's the rush in getting an exit visa. I know it's important, but these things they -- they take time." 

"I hope you're not one of those tattletale stooges in the Party who tell on every Dick and Jane in hopes to get a promotion. You're in too deep for that. I just want to leave in the same train you do. And for that I cook your meals, and I please you in bed. A fair agreement, I would say." <- Evasive language indicates subversive machinations. Ms. Leitzka is plying services  in exchange for an exit visa.

You observe that after this conversation, Hassel does not say a word. Neither does Leitzka. They both retire to their rooms, with no further activity of note.

#### Day 2

Surveillance start at 0500 hours on Wednesday, March 10th.

The day starts for Hassel at 0630 hours, followed by Lietzka shortly thereafter. The Field Office has instructed you to take less detailed notes as a comprehensively detailed description is not worth the Ministry's time.

You observe subjects Lietzka and Hassel exchange pleasentries over breakfast prepared by Lietzka. From the objects obserbed to taken from the refrigerator, it is an egg-based breakfast. More to follow. Casual conversation follows, over the morning radio broadcast. 

At around 0730, you observe a phone call is made to Hassel's residence. Records indicate the call is from The People's Electronics Fabricant, approximately 700 meters away from the Hassel surveillance site, Hassel's workplace. On the other line is Hassel's boss, citizen Gerhart Kleiner, Head of Day-Shift Production. The conversation is as follows:

Hassel (H): This is Albert Hassel, number HXT9115. To who am I speaking?

Kleiner (K): Yes, Hassel. This is Kleiner, I need to speak to you about the papers you submitted for a promotion. I don't know what dirt you have on that blowhard Mayer, but it worked. You will be promoted to Engineer Team Lead, beginning next semester. 

H: Ah, Mr. Kleiner! That is the best news I have heard in a long time.

K: Yeah, yeah. Probably you should start packing but not quickly, who knows when Housing is going to assign you your new flat. Even though they should. Don't get too comfortable though, the Party is breathing down my neck.

H: How so?

K: Well, you haven't been a good enough boy, Hassel. What do you want me to say? You're a no-show at your local Party meetings, and even if you say you tutor children as volunteer work that's not going to be enough in your new position. You know, they might actually block your promotion if you don't show your face around at least.

H: Oh c'mon Kleiner, a man's got to have some peace and quiet! I get back home, and I have cook my meals, sweep my floors... I got things to do other than sit every week for two or three hours to hear some patsy from Berlin-

K: Don't you be starting now, you never know who's listening. At any rate, the Party wants your face in their offices as soon as possible. Have something to hand them, anything will do.

H: That how you got ahead Mr. Keliner? Making stuff up and hoping nobody catches on?

K: I swear to God boy, it's like you're begging to be taken away. I am not answering that.

H: My mistake, my mistake. I got some legitimate to show at the Party offices so I'll pop over there after I'm done working.

K: Nah, we're so close to *meeting* our production quotas for the year it isn't worth it to even turn on the machines. Leadership decided to give the day off to everyone, and I'd rather save you the nasty surprise of coming to the factory to an empty floor. It's probably going to take you the whole day at the Party offices anyway.

H: Really? How is everyone else going to know the factory's closed?

K: Does that sound like my problem, Hassel? I am giving you a courtesy call, that should be enough for you.

H: That's fine Kleiner, always a pleasure talking to you and thank you for the heads up.

Before hanging up, the microphone on the phone picks up Hassel muttering "Little tyrant..." <- Prospect for a promotion does not really reflect a subersive element for the intergity of the State.

You observe Lietzka take notice of the conversation that just transpired. "Good news, from the looks of it." She comments.

Hassel sits down and takes a bite of his nondescript breakfast. "Uhm, yes. Looks like I will be getting a promotion come June. Before that I have to make good with the Party. If I show up we might actually see those exit visas, finally." He responds.

"Well that's dandy." Lietzka says. This is the first time you have observed her smile since coming across her dossier and surveillance started. "I guess you and that Gerhart made like thieves with the production numbers, if they're so good they're giving off holidays like they were bargains." She comments. <- Lying about meeting production quotas is a serious offense and classifed as a cause for sedition accusations. However, the investigation to prove subversion to the state through industry will not suffice the needs of the surveillance investigation.

"For once, woud it kill you to be happy for me Nadine?" Hassel says angrily. "We have our numbers, everyone at the factory gets a new thing to put on their tables, and for once we're producing what we actually need to produce instead of brand new chips just sitting in warehouses where they won't go anywhere. If there is a surplus of demand, then the market will adjust if it can't go anywhere."

Leitzka smirks. "I see you've been reading lover-boy." 

Hassel chuckles. "Hey, it doesn't hurt to take a leaf from the West's handbook every now and then."

Leitzka laughs lightly at that remark.

Hassel finishes his breakfast and starts to walk out the door. "I will be gone probably all day, so don't wait for me. You could visit Laurie, actually. You told me you enjoy her company." 

Leitzka looks dejected. "Yes, I guess..." Hassel then leaves the flat and exits the building. 

You phone the Party offices near Hassel's residence to send a Telefax to report his arrival. You give instructions to retain him as much as possible, for as long as possible.

You observe Letizka is the only person in the apartment. You observe her sit on the living room sofa and pull out a briefcase from under it. She opens it and starts shuffling around its contents. She ponders on a couple of items for a long period of time. From the faint noises you hear through the surveillance microphones, it seems that she is crying over the contents of this briefcase. 

You hear faint whispers, "One day, one day, one day" in between the sobs.

After around thirty minutes of silence and cotemplation, Leitzka puts the briefcase back under the sofa and leaves the flat.

Surveillance around the building, provided by the same Field Office, indicates that she did not visit her neighbor Laurie Weiss. Instead she decided to sit down at the nearby park and playground and pass the time in silence there.

Within fifteen minutes of Leitzka leaving, you decide to execute a search and sweep of Hassel's flat to improve the surveillance apparatus and investigate out of sight areas and rooms.

Enter the flat.

The surveillance team enters the flat. At your direction, they install cameras in the remaining two bedrooms of the flat. As it happens, the map you were given was incorrect, and there is only one additional room that is not surveyed, and a bathroom that is not surveyed. Since there is no way to incorporate additional cameras, more microphones are placed in using the wires of existing equipment. On the living room there are two objects of interest. A book on top of the coffee table, and the briefcase Leitzka had taken from under the sofa.

Look at the book: The cover seems to indicate a perfectly normal cooking book, but one the dust jacket is removed, the true contents reveal themselves to be Freedom of Nations by Adam Smith.

Look at the briefcase: The briefcase reveals itself to be an assortments of various knick knacks of personal siginficance to Leitzka. On top of the pile, two items of interest. You snap a picture for the evidence file.

A picture: A faded, sepia tone picture of a woman holding two children. The picture seems to have been taken some time ago, presumably more than ten years ago. You take out a pocket camera and snap a picture that will record what the photo is. Given that the picture was still somewhat warm, this is most likely the object Nadine Lietzka was crying over.

A scribbled map: A hastily scribbled diagram which is some sort of map on slight aged graphing paper. It seem to indicate a series of roads and sewer tunnels. You take out a pocket camera and snap a picture of that diagram.

You return the objects to their previous state and exit the premises with care to not have been seen inside or leave any trace of yourselves. 

Several hours later, Hassel returns to the flat with a package under his arm and places it on the kitchen table. Cameras are not able to distinguish who is the package for or what it contains. However, this is not standard procedure: Subjects under direct surveillance of the Ministry of State Safety are by policy not allowed to recieve any mail unless already examined and reported to the acting surveillance Agent.

You phone in immediately to Division XIX to ask for a status report.

Division XIX reports no parcels were addressed to Albert Hassel or Nadine Leitzka therefore there was nothing to intercept. 

Nadine Leitzka does not return until late in the evening, after Hassel had already eaten and gone to bed. You do not detect any night time activities between the two of them.

#### Day 3

Surveillance start at 0500 hours on Thursday, March 11th.

At around 0600, you observe a phone call is made to Hassel's residence. The phone ring wakes up Hassel and Leitzka, forcing Hassel to get out of bed earlier than previously observed. Records indicate the call is from The People's Electronics Fabricant, approximately 700 meters away from the Hassel surveillance site, Hassel's workplace. On the other line is Hassel's boss, citizen Gerhart Kleiner, Head of Day-Shift Production. The conversation is as follows:

Hassel (H): Who in the hell is ca-

Kleiner (K): It's me you idiot. Did you fuck the Party official's wife or something?

H: W-what?

K: Did you fuck the Party official's wife? Answer me!

H: No, no! Of course not, Kleiner! Why would you even ask me that?

K: I got called to meet to my local Party secretary in the dead of night last night. He was angry, Keliner. Angry that I would pick you to lead the Engineering team. He said that you have no loyalty to the Party... to the country! What did you DO?!

H: I sat there for five hours then spoke to the official about my tutoring work, what else was I supposed to do?

K: Well, they must have mistaken you for some other Hassel, because they're come down on me now. If I don't drop you as Lead they will come and investigate me, you, and everyone and everything else at the factory. I don't know why you talked me into reducing the output to meet what we sold. I should have never listen-

H: I talked you into it? Dear God, Kleiner don't you start lying now. We decided on it, remember?

K: No, no. No, no, no. You -- 

Kleiner grunts angrily, blowing off steam.

K: You're lucky, damn lucky, to keep your job. Forget about a promotion, as long as you're working under me you'll be staying where you are and you can sit with the bag of shit the Party drops on you. I am not having any of it.

H: Kleiner? Kleiner! I swear I didn't do-

The phone call is over from Kleiner's side of the line.

You observe that while the call was taking place, some activity is heard in the bedroom. A bag being zipped open, what seems like clothes being stuffed in a bag, and the bag zipped shut. 

"GOD-DAMN-IT!" You observe Hassel scream as he slams the phone on the cradle. The noise it makes through the speakers forces you to wince. 

 You observe Lietzka emerge from the hallway in sleeping clothes, rubbing her eyes. "Maybe you want to be louder to make sure you wake up everyone in the block, Albert." she says in between a yawn.

Hassel pays no mind to this remark and goes back through the hallway, presumably to get dressed. Audio information indicates this, and he emerges from the hallway again hastily dressed in his normal civilian clothes.

"I have to run to the Party headquerters and set this right, Nadine." He says in a hurried tone. "Everything has gone wrong, I don't think they have the right Albert Hassel. This is terrible, Nadine. Terrible."

You observe Hassel grab the suspicious package observed yesterday and hand it over to Lietzka. "Here," he says. "this came in the mail for you. I don't recall you had told anyone that you had moved in with me, but it seems our dear government knows everything before I do." 

You observe Nadine taking the package. It is notable that she does not seem surprised or phased by the package's appearance, suggesting she was expecting it already. <- The suspicious package unaccounted for by Division XIX was sent to Nadine. 

Hessel goes in for a kiss on the cheek to Leitzka, something she rebuffs by looking away. Hassel's tone gets increasingly angrier. "So that's how it's going to be now, is it? Even you, the little wannabe capitalist I should have reported ages ago, is going to abandon me the moment things go wrong?" 

Leitzka scoffs. You observe her going to the living room, grabbing the book on top of the coffee table and cradles it like a baby. "Perhaps it was a mistake to trust you Albert. I hate that I am reaching that conclusion right now." 

"Perhaps I made a mistake of my own," Albert rebuffs "because I really trusted you. I truly did." This gets a surprise out of Leitzka. "I thought finding you was an act of divine providence, I got to see the girl I loved when I was just a scholboy and do all the things I desperately wanted to do back then. I should have know better -- better than to allow you to live with me when you lie and lie and lie to me."

Leitzka truns around without saying a word and dissappears out of the camera frame. "Yes, Nadine. Please! Run away, run away like you always do. Like you do in your 'visits to the cafeteria'. I asked the cashier about you to make small talk, and you would never guess what happened? She has never heard of you! Ever! I just assumed you went out of your way to go to another coffee shop I don't know about, silly me! I asked Laurie about you, and she said you had not seen each other in three months! Sily me, maybe we are talking about different Lauries, convenient!" Hassel lashes out as he puts on his shoes. <- Leitzka covertly leaves the flat without a known destination.

"Oh God, don't speak that woman's name in my presence again, Albert! That woman has a wet sponge for a brain!" Leitzka snaps back from a location away form the cameras, presumably the bedroom they both share. 

"Shout it louder, dear!" Hassel responds. "Who knows who is listening, it might be her!" 

Lietzka comes into the living room again and slaps Hassel across the face. You observe Hassel taken aback, completely caught off guard. A brief silence is exchanged between the two of them.

"I-I-I'm leaving, Albert. We-wer're through. I wish I had never given you my book to read, or my pamphlets for that m-matter. When you walk out that door, and go see your party w-whatever, I will have left. Yes... yes. I will have left" Leitzka stammered through that, but as she kept deliniating her plans, she became resolute. <- Wealth of Nations copy is owned by Nadine Leitzka.

You observe Hassel staring at her, and they exchange another brief silence. Hassel's facial expressions are not intelligible through the camera, but it is a safe bet he is processing Leitzka's words. "The moment I saw those leaflets from United Left I should have dropped you at the police station. But, I will keep my silence, and I should caution you to keep yours." He finally says coldly. <- Hassel did not report Leitzka, however Leitzka is in the posession of directly subversive literature.

"You do know I wanted to get away to Latvia for a few days for you, right? I had it all planned out," Hassel says softly, just above the threshold for microphone pick up. "No," Leitzka responds " not far enough. Not nearly far enough. I thought we could leave, together. But you're afraid, too afraid. And, I don't blame you."

You observe Leitzka taking a deep breath.

"If you saw what I see for the future, it would scare you." <- Leitzka quoted Josip Tito.

You observe Hassel leave the apartment and slam the door shut. Leitzka returns to the bedroom, and more noises from the audio feed coincide with clothes and various belongings being arranged hastily in a bag. You phone the Party offices Hassel frequents to delay him for an hour, but to ultimately put in a formal document to clarify his status with Gerhart Kleiner. You phone the local constabulary to await and detain Nadine Leitzka, as she poses a flight risk.

You observe Leitzka appearing again on camera, leaving through the front door of the flat. The suspicious package clearly in her possession.

At 0730, a teletype comes in confirming the detainment of one Nadine Leitzka matching the description of the subject in observation.

Nothing of not happens in the following two hours.

At 0945, you observe Hassel enter the apartment with labored breath. "Nadine! Nadine!" He screams. Nobody responds. He inspects the rooms in the flat, looking for Leitzka.

When he has confirmed Leitzka left the premises, he sits on the sofa in silence, and opens a cabinet next to him. Form it he produces a cigarrette pack, a lighter, and a small porcelain dish. You observe him light up a cigarrette and smoke it in silence.

After finishing his cigarrette, you observe him pick up the phone and let it produce the open line tone. He starts speaking into the telephone as if somebody was on the other line, when there isn't. His breath is labored, presumably from the cigarrette he just smoked.

Hassel: Are you listening? Of course you are, you are the State Security. Are you enjoying this? Did you watch me an Nadine going at it? Did you watch us eat breakfast and watch television? I hope it was worth it, I hope you got something out of it as much as you did you damn perverts. Always looking, always watching, I do wonder when did I catch your attention. Was it when she came in the apartment? Was it when she gave me that book to read? You know something, I loved it. I loved reading about, I loved reading about how you could actually make something out of yourself instead of a thumb made a million bureaucrats pushing you down. I work, and I work.... and I work until I'm a ragged doll and I will get a scoop of mud and a punch to the head for my troubles. But it's not enough is it? It's not enough for you, you also have to drink from my cup and eat from my plate, and watch me, watch me, watch us all take a dump, fall in love, have a thought. Watch us forever. Nadine wanted to leave so bad... Maybe I'd like to go too... To a place you can't find me, you can't watch me, you can't hear me you... You --hnnng-- f-f-f-fffuck-fucking professional perverts in the Stasi. Fuck you, fuck you all to hell."

The one-sided conversation ended here.

You put in a word at the local constabularies for the detainment of Albert Hassel should he exit a 30 meter perimeter from the low-rises. He is also at flight risk.

Given that both of the subjects of surveillance have order for detention, cover surveillance is no longer advisable nor necessary. It's time to submit all evidence to Leiutenant Brice and Sargeant Bayer to determine probable cause for subversion of the state. You take your last notes and start putting together the case files.

"Do you have a formal case envelope around here?" You ask. A simple manila folder won't do, presentation is important after all.

You recieve a pretty, laminated document protector, embossed with the words "Ministry of State Security of the Democratic Republic of Germany."

That name, Stasi. It bothers you. It bothers everyone you work with. These ingrates should just come out with it and call you what they really mean in their hearts and minds. But of course, you'll always be listening. If not you, someone. Even when they think they aren't they do. For their safety.

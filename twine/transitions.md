## Day 1 into Day 2

Home at last. One bedroom flat not too close to central, but not too far either. Modestly decorated, more function than form.

Why? Well, you know they're here.

They must be.

You don't know where exactly, but being an Agent of the ministry you could probably make some educated guesses right on the mark. Every night you come back you get the nagging feeling of getting your tools to look for the wires. Your hand itches for them, longing to unravel electrical cables like a yarn. The tools beckon at you, plead you, prod you. 

You turn around and your eye scans the places that you immediately identified as being odd, misshapen, out of place: That crooked light switch panel overlooking the living room, those odd globs of paint on the ceiling, telling of a brush stroke that went against the grain, the gap in the pattern of the wall scroll that adorned your kitchen. There were too many.

Too many to count.

But they're looking at you, watching, with their beady little eyes up on the wall. You stare back at them, as many as you can. Making sure that they know you are aware of them. These pinpricks voids mounted to wood and plaster were the real bread and butter, the sword and shield of the state. You'd be easily thrown to a cell and left to rot for half a century with ease. But them? These eyes? They are trusted beyond reproach and question. The frenchman that invented the camera was a hero of yours, as well as a character that you absolutely loved and loathed: His sons and daughters were stalwart allies and merciless witnesses. Nothing you'd ever do would be a secret. 

Closing your eyes is the only escape, so you do for five hours. But you were sure they'd eventually find a way to put a mole in the inside of your eye lid and in your mind's eye. Those scientists that spend their waking  hours coming up with smaller and more impractical cameras are capable of almost anything. At least someone has to be trying that.

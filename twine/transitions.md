## Day 1 into Day 2

Home at last. One bedroom flat not too close to central, but not too far either. Modestly decorated, more function than form.

Why? Well, you know they're here.

They must be.

You don't know where exactly, but being an Agent of the Ministry you could probably make some educated guesses right on the mark. Every night you come back you get the nagging feeling of getting your tools to look for the wires. Your hand itches for them, longing to unravel electrical cables like a yarn. The tools beckon at you, plead you, prod you.

[[Jezebel beckons king David towards her, her gaze suspending the godly man's judgement enough to damn him for an eternity and a day. He is not innocent, and he's not entirely guilty. But the justice we seek does not deal in half measures.]]

You turn around and your eye scans the places that you immediately identified as being odd, misshapen, out of place: That crooked light switch panel overlooking the living room, those odd globs of paint on the ceiling, telling of a brush stroke that went against the grain, the gap in the pattern of the wall scroll that adorned your kitchen. There were too many.

Too many to count.

But they're looking at you, watching, with their beady little eyes up on the wall. You stare back at them, as many as you can. Making sure that they know you are aware of them. These pinpricks voids mounted to wood and plaster were the real bread and butter of the sword and shield of the state. You'd be easily thrown to a cell and left to rot for half a century if you spoke out of turn. But them? These eyes? They are trusted beyond reproach and question. The Frenchman that invented the camera was a hero in your eyes. Your heart sings his praises while at the same time reviles his mother, that creature that damned the world with her terrible spawn: The Frenchman's sons and daughters were stalwart allies and merciless witnesses. Nothing you'd ever do would be a secret, and nothing they, all of them, would ever be a secret either.

Closing your eyes is the only escape, a five-hour sanctuary. But you were sure they'd eventually find a way to put a mole in your eyelids and maybe one day get in your mind's eye. The scientists that spend their waking hours coming up with smaller and more impractical cameras are capable of almost anything. At least someone has to be trying that. Perhaps one day they'd get you to photograph your life on your own volition.

[[They lie in waiting like lionesses in the light, and you're an antelope -- weak and scared. Your world is split in two with eyes on opposite sides so hopefully you'll see them coming behind you. But trusting your senses is like praying, you lose very little if you do it but it guarantees nothing.]]-1

[[Silence is your dear friend, the only freedom you may have here and now. They come for you for every minute of every day, a second unaccounted for is a second where you might have something in your head that can't be written, mimeographed, photographed, captured, recorded, reported, filed, analyzed, evaluated, debriefed. Your life is a scrapbook, collections of people and events and all of these things that you hope against hope that someone looks and likes what they see. Being forgotten is a luxury now relinquished to an authority that is distant and indifferent.]]-2

[[Silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is silence is as precious as all the money in the world and then it's as worthless as a single grain of sand.]]-3

As the darkness of sleep envelops you, it whispers to you words impossible to pronounce, and the world fades into little pinprick dots in the sky looking down on you.

## Day 2 into Day 3

The last rays of the sun escape to the West as you turn the key and open the door to your flat. Today is dishwashing day and floor sweeping day.

No, no it isn't.

Technically floor sweeping day was yesterday, but you couldn't be bothered to do that.

Dishwashing? No, not that either.

The dust bunnies and the slimy plates sitting at the bottom of your sink will live to fester and grow another day. It's time to flaunt the rules and live slovenly. You can't even bring yourself to the warmth of a shower. Even that small moment of solitude demands too much out of you. Too much of what you are not at liberty to say. Effort? Time? Comfort? Freedom? A moment to finally be alone with your thoughts.

But you're never alone are you?

You would not bat an eye to think that there was a micro-membrane microphone hooked up just below the bath window. How many of those have you installed those in the last year? Ten, Twenty? There's always some kind of glee, some kind of joy, every time the spec for an operation requires a device in the bathroom. There's already so much you know about them, the public might as well live in glass houses. You wish that was the new thing. Would save you a lot of time, would save them the need to hide.

[[That was so lame wasn't it? Under the bed? That's the first place that anyone that has ever done any spy work will think to look. The age to hide things under the furniture is ten years old maximum. What did you expect? What did you think was going to happen, you dull, dull girl? And she is an accomplice to a plot against state security? What a joke.]]-1

[[You like that don't you. There they are, naked as the day they were born. And when it's a young woman, ooh. You're a schoolchild all over again peeking between the stripes of frosted glass, trying to catch a glimpse of something. And they pay you to listen to them? To see them, on occasion? And they're none the wiser, that in a dark room there you are, typewriter on hand, reporting and listening in. But you can't record video, no, no. So those lines, those smooth taut skins they're a delight for you and you alone.]]-2

The bed greets you, and with arms wide open you greet it.

The dark of your eyelids coalesces in purple and black globs of a thick ocean. In those curls and stretches, falling into themselves in a labyrinth, you can see. Whatever is left of your mind as if drifts away can see things. You can find these images stretching and contracting, congealing into shapes and colors that you could not describe.

Sounds echo and then disappear.

And then they are with you. This sausage looking man, and this spindly wire-looking woman with eyes so black they punch a hole in the whitest canvas you could think of. They open their mouths producing noises unknowable.

[[There they are, you pervert. There they are, and they know what you are doing. Aren't you going to say something? Don't you have anything to say for yourself? Oh, that it's your job, that if not you then someone else, and if they were in your position they'd do the same? Perhaps. Anything is possible when you pick up these small baby birds and at a moment's notice snuff them out by clenching your fists. They dance. They dance on the palm of your hand. You dance on someone else's. All it takes is for someone to tighten their grip, and everything in it dies.]]-1

The colors shine and dim, a million lightbulbs actuated by a million different switches, turned on and off by a million different hands. They pulse rhythmically, as if they were breathing. You think that you can touch them, and still they seem to escape your grasp. You try to look at your arm but it's a mess of smoke and bits of aluminum shavings. You feel yourself dissolve and precipitate.

One moment you're here... wherever that is.

[[Hey, do you like her? Do you like him? One of them will never see sunlight again, but do you even care?]]

Another you're stretched far and wide, like a film.

[[I wish they could just rat on themselves. Get them sacked, get them thrown out, get them a room with no light and walls closing in. They must have done something to deserve it. Your wrath is just, your hammer is guided by the truth. It's your turn to do what you can, and for them to suffer what they must.]]

You feel their gazes intensify, the lights all around you. Like being cooked slowly in a pot.

[[It is your right as the institution. All of this is righteous. They will be accountable. They will respond for their actions. And only when they grovel on their hands and knees can they even ask for redemption. It will never come. Subhuman creatures do not deserve to walk among us.]]

The warmth pulls you in and you fall forever, a millimeter an hour.

## Day 3 into Day 4

As soon as you close your eyes, you see those two again.

They are phasing in and out, in and out with the nebula of dust and colors. You can still see their features: Their eyes, and their mouths, and their noses. You see their arms and legs in one moment, and the other they go away. Like they were made of smoke. You saw them as big as a tower, and as small as a fly. The are stretching onto infinity and escaping the horizon of things you could see.

They open their mouths, and once again, the sounds they make are unintelligible. They make these long vocal sounds that smell like week-old fish and the gunk that sits on your sink.

"Are you happy?" You hear a voice ask you.

You try to see their mouths again but they are vibrating like ripple on a pond.

"Are you happy?" The voice asks again.

The colors are gone, the faces of Nadine Leitzka and Albert Hassel are too. In their place is the dark of space dotted with stars. But it's not a night outside you are dreaming of. Instead , you notice that the atmosphere gets thicker and warmer.

"Are you happy with what you do?" The voice asks. It reminds you of your mother, a throaty baritone with the sweetest sounding voice. But she's gone. She has been gone for a while. She's been gone since well, that Wall went up.

You must be in a furnace because the lights have become bigger, and brighter. And the air around you gets thicker, like a soup. And the voice that rings in your head spreads out around you and you hear them all ask you questions.

[[]]"Are you happy with what you do?" "Who are those lovely people are you watching?" "Is today enough to condemn them forever?" "What if you're seeing them on a bad day?" "Could they really be that evil?" "What is a threat to the State?"]]

The lights are getting warmer and brighter, the darkness is repelled and all that's left is the light.

[["Did Lieutenant Sessler ever tell you if they were actually bad people?" "Do you know why Bayer wanted to be a part of all of this?" "Why you?" "Why are you watching people who could be criminals?" "Aren't you tired of listening on them?" "They cannot be that fascinating to look at?" "Is it too late to quit now?"]]

The last shadow is blotted away, and the lights beam you with searing heat.

"Will you be ok after all is said and done?"

What kind of question is that? They're all looking at you. They're all looking? It hurts, what they're doing is hurting. You can feel the lights staring into you, stripping you off the layers of skin. On the surface of whatever it is that you're standing you feel something. Something round and perhaps a bit mushy. You try to stand but it's become so slippery.

In an instant the colors blur, the all encompassing whiteness gives way to a few blotches of brown, and then an inky black below you. All around you the same light starts to burn your flesh. You focus on them, wondering what is it that made you experience these things, and how to make it stop. And then you face the floor again, just so you could have any sense of sight back. You have been sitting in an inky black circle, surrounded by a myriad colors of brown, red, and terracotta tones, flanked by the white that continues to torture you.

It's looking at you too.

You feel your flesh pierced by the light, the air is so hot you would swear you could catch on fire. All you can do is curl up in a ball and close your eyes hoping that it will all go away. Even so, you can feel it, all around you. They are all looking at you, observing you, unmaking you by not affording you a single shred of yourself to be owned by you. You want to scream, so you open your mouth.

Nothing comes out.

Somehow they enter your ears and your mouth, pried open by forces unseen. How could you? If you open your eyes again they'd melt too. Something enters you, and starts removing whatever is inside. It's organs? No, no. It's not material. But it feels real, it feels important, what they're taking away from you.

There will be nothing left of you, once they have no more use for you.

[[You ever wonder why you've never seen an Agent that was older than forty-five years of age. Have you ever seen a retired Agent before? No, no I guess not. They're all gone long before then. You wonder where have they gone. It could be out to the countryside.

But that's not true. They will see you. You know that they will see you. And whatever you do, you won't be able to apologize, or to restitute. Once they're done, you are only a liability. ]] -1

You feel yourself being torn from the inside out, you are no longer.

You are folded you into a stretchy flimsy thing with thin filaments. More of you is gone moment by moment.

And at last, you no longer have eyes to close.

There's only the eyes that see into the unknowable void. And you are one of them.
